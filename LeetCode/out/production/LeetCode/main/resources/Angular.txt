AngularJS is a flexible JavaScript MVC framework for building rich client-side applications.
AngularJS is a framework, not a JavaScript library like jQuery.

 It runs on plain JavaScript and HTML, so you don’t need any other dependencies to make it work.
 AngularJS is perfect for Single Page Applications (SPA).
 It is basically used for binding JavaScript objects with HTML UI elements.


2 way data binding ,supports MVC pattern (model-data ,view controller
support Rest Ful services ,Form Validation ,Custom directives,Dependency injection
Client and server communication,event handling
The key features of AngularJS are:

Scope
Controller
Model
View
Services use across controller by injecting
Data Binding
Directives
Filters
Testable

ng-app : Initializes application.
ng-model : Binds HTML controls to application data(controller).
ng-Controller : Attaches a controller class to view.
ng-repeat : Bind repeated data HTML elements. Its like a for loop.
ng-if : Bind HTML elements with condition.
ng-show : Used to show the HTML elements.
ng-hide : Used to hide the HTML elements.
ng-class : Used to assign CSS class.
ng-src : Used to pass the URL image etc.

ng-change when any of the UI element changes ,you call this method ,

//Scope is an object that refers to the application model
The scope is the object that represents the “model” of your application.
It contains fields that store data which is presented to the user via the template,
as well as functions which can be called when the user performs certain actions
such as clicking a button.

it takes an empty scope object and adds fields  and logic that will be exposed to user
via the view
Controllers are Javascript functions which provide data and logic to HTML UI.
//keep logic in controller
As the name suggests, they control how data flows from the server to HTML UI.

promises/routing/controllers

According to AngularJS.org, “Data-binding in Angular apps is the
automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components.

We can share data by creating a service,
Services are easiest, fastest and cleaner way to share data between controllers in An

A core feature of AngularJS, directives are attributes that allow you to invent new HTML syntax,
 specific to your application. They are essentially functions that execute when the Angular compiler
  finds them in the DOM.
Some of the most commonly used directives are ng-app
directive is used to flag the HTML element that Angular should consider to be the root element of our application

,ng-controller and ng-repeat.



The different types of directives are:

Element directives
Attribute directives
CSS class directives
Comment directives

‘Promises’ are post processing logics which are executed after some operation/action
is completed whereas ‘deferred’ is used to control how and when those promise logics will execute.
We can think about promises as “WHAT” we want to fire after an operation is
completed while deferred controls “WHEN” and “HOW” those promises will execute.
“$q” is the angular service which provides promises and deferred functionality.

It is a five-step process:

Step 1: – Add the “Angular-route.js” file to your view.
Step 2: – Inject “ngroute” functionality while creating Angular app object.
Step 3: – Configure the route provider.
Step 4: – Define hyperlinks. templateUrl and you give the controller
Step 5: – Define sections where to load the view

controllers provide data and
