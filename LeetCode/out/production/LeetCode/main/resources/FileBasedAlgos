External merge sort ,how will you sort a file of size 2 GB
Answer

Lets assume we have X MB of memory available ,
Divide the file into k chunks where X *K =2 GB
900 MB data to be sorted using 100 MB of RAM
Read  first chunk of 100 MB of data in memory ,sort is in Nlog(N) time
Repeat for all 9 chunks
X/(K+1) bring this much amount of sorted chunk ,
Read 10 MB of each sorted chunk in main memory and allocate 10 MB for o/p buffer and
write it to the final sorted file
Perform a K way merge sort and store result in output buffer, if any of the  chunk buffer gets empty
read it with the next 10MB of its associated 100 MB and if there is no more data

difference between factory and service
