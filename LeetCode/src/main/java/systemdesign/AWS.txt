----------------Introduction
Distractor services?

---------------------Section 3------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
Through a cloud services platform with a pay as you go compute pricing
Can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
You can access as many resources instantly

#Deployment models for cloud
	Private cloud-> Cloud services used by a single organization not exposed to the public(managed by someone else)
	Complete control
	Security for sensitive applications
#Public Cloud
	Cloud services owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
#Hybrid Cloud
		Some servers on premises
		Some on third party cloud
		Sensitive data on prem, flexibility and cost effectiveness of public cloud
#FiveCharacteristics
		On Demand Self Service
		Broad network access
		Multitenancy and resource sharing
		Rapid elasticity and scalability
		Measured Service -> pay as you use
#SixAdvantages
	Trade Capex for Opex
	Benefits from massive economies of scale
	Stop guessing capacity
	Increased speed and agility
	Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
	Go Global in few minutes
Problems Solved
	Flexibility
	Cost Effectiveness
	Scalability
	Elasticity
	High availability and Fault tolerance
	Agility ->rapidly, develop, test and launch software applications

Types of Cloud Computing
	On prem						---> Applications, data, runtime, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, networking	
	Infrastructure As a service--> dont have to manage virtualization, servers, storage, networking	
	Platform as a service----> dont have to manage runtime, middleware, O/S, virtualization, servers, storage, networking ..Only applications and data
	Software as a service-----> Also applications and data everything is managed 	
		
AWS pricing model
			Compute-> pay for compute time
			Storage-> pay for amount of data stored
			Networking-> Pay when Data leaves the cloud
		Thus we only pay what we need
AWS history
			2002->internal
			2004 SQS first public launch and offering
			2006 relaunch with EC2, SQS
AWS regions
			All around the workd
			Names can be us-east-l, eu-west-3
			A region is a cluster of data centers
			Most AWS services are region scoped?
How do you choose an AWS region?
			Compliance --Data in france should be in france
			Latency--> close to users
			Available services--->Are the services you are looking for available in the region
			Pricing
Availability Zones
			One or more discrete data center with redundant power, networking and connectivity
			Each AWS region has many availability zones (min 3 max 6)
			Separate from each other so isolated from disasters	
			Connected to each other with ultra low latency high bandwidth networking
AWS points of presence?			
		216

AWS console
		Global console for some services such as Route 53
		IAM is a global service encompasses all regions
		For EC2 view is different for each region in terms of the resources one sees	
AWS global infrastructure
		Information around services
AWS regional services
	Gives you services list by a region
	If you dont see a service then you may have to switch region in the console because not all services are located in the same region
	New EC2 experience toggle on top left.. switching it off would make the old UI appear
Shared Responsibility Model for Security 
	You as a customer are responsibility for security in the cloud--> security, data, network firewall conf,platform, application, identity and access management
	AWS Responsible for security of the cloud-->infra, hardware, software, internal security

---------------------Section 4------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM
		Global Service
		Root Account shouldnt be used or shared
		Create users for people within your organization and if needed users can be grouped together
		Groups can only contain users, not other groups
		a user can belong to multiple togethers
		A user may not be part of any group but its not best practice
		Groups for permissions
		Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
		Policies define what permissions can be assigned to users -> effect, action & resource
		Least privelege principle: Dont give a user more permission than he needs
		IAM->Create user->add user to a created group admin with Admin access policy
		Tags key value pairs to add information to assist search capabilities when searching resources.
Account Alias
		Helps you create alias and generate sign in URL for users of your account ..the users can then sign in as IAM user
		https://-*.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
		IAM user will show as IAM user in the right hand side
		Root will show as root
		Preferred to login as IAM user
IAM Policies Inheritance
IAM Policy Structure
			Version,Id,One or more Statements, a statement has Sid(Optional), Effect->allow,deny, Principal->account, role to which this policy applies to 
			Action->List of action this policy allows or denies, resources-> list of resources to which the actions are applied to
Inline policy-> policy directly for a user
You can also create custom policies


----------------------Section 5-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EC2
Billing & Budget
		If you let IAM users who are admins to access billing data: From root->account->edit IAM user and role access to billing information
		IAM user/role access to billing information is activated.
		Now login as IAM user
		Home--> see bills--> charges by account, by service etc
		AWS Free TierInfo --> gives info about AWS free tier
		Set up Budget-> To control cost->Choose budget type-->zero spend budget, monthly cost budget
		
EC2 
		Elastic compute cloud ..one of the most popular of AWS offering
		Infrastructure as a service
		Rent virtual machines (EC2), store data on virtual drives (EBS), distribute load across machines (ELB), Scale services using autoscale group ASG	
EC2 sizing and configuration
	OS,Compute power and cores,RAM,storage space - network attached(EBS &EFS), network card, firewall rules security group
	Bootstrap script	
EC2 user data
	BootStrap script (configure at first launch)...bootstrap instances using EC2 User Data Script	
	Script is run only at first start
	bootstrapping launching commands when a machine starts
	EC2 user data runs with the root user.. so sudo root
	t2 micro is part of aws free tier (up to 750 hours in a month)
	Need key pairs for SSH
	.pem for above windows 10
	Allow HTTP traffice from internet because we have to configure web server
	Delete on termination EBS--> once we terminate the volume is also going to be deleted
	Advanced-> User data ..enter following bootstrap code (Install web server)
	
	#!/bin/bash
	# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
	# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
	yum update -y
	yum install -y httpd
	systemctl start httpd
	systemctl enable httpd
	echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
	Use http://public ip
	Private Ip to connect from outside
	Stop instance---> no longer billed..instance state is kept
	however the public ip might have changed, private ip will always same

EC2 instance types
	https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
	A)General Purpose
		m5.2xlarge
		m instance, 5 generation, 2x large size of instance
		t2.micro general purpose ec2 instance
	B) Compute Optimized

		High performance (in memory databases for BI)
		Real time processing of unstructured data
		R6, R5
	D) Storage optimized
		Storage intensive tasks that require high sequential read, write access to large data sets on local storage
		Distributed file systems
		OLTP systems
		I4

Security Groups







------------------------Amazon S3-------------------------------------------------
One of the main building blocks of AWS
At its core, its storage(backup, storage)
Infinitely scaling storage	
Many websites use Amazon S3 as the backbone
Many AWS services use Amazon s3 as an integration as well	

Uses
	Backup and storage
	Disaster recovery
	to host media
	to host applications 
	Static Website
	Archive
	Static website
	Nasdaq stores 7 years of data into s3 Glacier
Amazon S3
	Allows users to stores object (file) into buckets)top level directories
	Must have a globally unique name
	Buckets are created in a region
	Objects (files) have a key
	prefix+ object name
	There are no directories..keys a very very long names with /
	Object Values are contents of the body
	Max object size is 5TB
	if uploading more than 5 gb must use multi part upload
	Bucket names globally unique
Bucket policy S3 security
	User based-> IAM policies --> which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
	Resource based-> bucket wide rules allows cross account, object ACL , bucket ACL 
	Another way is to encrypt object using encryption keys
S3 Bucket Policies
	Resource: buckets and objects the policy applies on 
	Effect Allow:Deny
	Actions: Set of API to allow/deny
	Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
	
	Anonymous user wants to access S3 bucket then use S3 bucket policy that allows public access
	IAM user wants to access S3 bucket, assign IAM permissions to user through policy, then user can access that S3 bucket
	EC2 instance wants access to S3 bucket, then IAM user permissions are not appropriate, we need to use EC2 instance role with correct IAM permissions and EC2 instance will get instance to s3 buckets
	Cross account access->use s3 bucket policy that allows cross account access
	For block public access-> by default to prevent company data leaks
	Can also be set at account level if none of your S3 buckets should ever be public
Hands on
	Make S3 as public
	Use policy generator https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html
	arn:aws:s3:::saurabh-******r-s3/*, get object
	principal->users
	resource is resource
	
	{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "Policy1679878858678",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1679878757567",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::saurabh-******r-s3/*"
        }
    ]
}
	
	
Static Website
		 S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the internet
		 Attach S3 bucket policy that allows it to be public (cannot be private)
		 S3 properties->static website hosting
Amazon S3 Versioning
		Versioning is possible
		Enabled at bucket level
		Same key overwrite will change version
		Protect unintended delete, rollbacks
		Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling will have version null
		Suspending will not delete the previous versions
	HandsOn
		Go to Properties->enable versioning
		Show versions 
		If you delete with show versions toggle off -> delete marker will override previous file
		Delete delete marker will restore previous file

Amazon S3 replication (CRR & SRR)

		
-------------------------------Databases -------------------------------------------------------
Storing data on EBS, S3, EFS, EC2 Instance store can have its limits		
No SQL Databases -Non relational
	Modern databases --> built for a specific data model and have flexible schema for building modern applications
	More flexibility, Scalable(Horizontal scaling) , High performance and highly functional ->optimized for a data model 
	Eg, key Value, Document, graph, In memory, search databases
	Data can be in JSON format
AWS will offer use to managed databases
		Advantages of managed database
		Quick provisioning, high availability, vertical and horizontal scaling , Upgrades, patching, monitoring , autmated backup & restore
		You can use EC2 but IaaS shortcomings
		
RDS
	Relational Database service.. Use SQL as query language
	OLTP
    Create databases in cloud managed by AWS ..PostGres, MySQL, Aurora (AWS proprietary database)
	Storage backed by EBS
	But you cant SSH into the instances
Aurora
	Supports 2 kinds of database technologies PostGres and My SQL
	AWS cloud optimized 5x performance improvement over My SQL on RDS
	Grows in increments of 10GB upto 128 TB
	Proprietary(not open source)
	RDS & Aurora are 2 ways of creating relation databases in AWS
	CLoud Native version
 
HandsOn
	Database port 3306
	VPC security group (firewall)Info
	Choose one or more VPC security groups to allow access to your database. Make sure that the security group rules allow the appropriate incoming traffic.
	New VPC security group name: demo-database-rds 
	Take a snapshot so that you can rollback

Actions can be done from RDS snapshot	
	You can restore from a snapshot to a new database, create a new database out of snapshot, create a db with different settings or a bigger db, or create a copy
	Copy snapshot to a different region for disaster recovery
	Share snapshot so you can share your copy of database to another accounts so they can create/restore the database from your snapshot

RDS Deployment Options
	Read Replicas
		Create Read Replicas ->distributing reads upto 15 read replicas
		Writing Data is done to only one main DB
		Sharing load
	MultiAz->
		Failover In case of AZ outage..
		Failover DB takes over in case the main DB is unaccessible due to AZ outage
		Reads and writes are written to the failover DB.it is passive
		Can have only 1 AZ as a failover zone
	MultiRegion(read replicas)
		Application and read replica exists in different zones
		Application reads data from read replica (local DB) in same AZ where the application exists
		All writes from applications across zones happen to one main Database
		Provides disaster recover strategy	
		low latency
		Cons: Replication cost associated with the network transfer data across regions
		
Amazon ElastiCache
	Managed Redis or Memcached
	Caches are in memory database with high performance, low latency
	Reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads

DynamoDB		
	Fully managed highly available with replication across 3 AZ

	standard and frequent IA table class
	Key->(partition key+sort key)
	Value->Column attributes

DynamoDB Accelator- DAX	
	Fully managed in memory cache for Dynamo DB	
	Integrated and only used with Dynamo DB (microsecond latency)
	Secure, highly scalable and highly available	
HandsOn
	Serverless, create db without having to create instances
	Cannot normalize.. link data between tables
	So we have to make sure our relevant data is well formatted within our main Dynamo DB table	

DynamoDB- Global tables
	Make a dynamoDB table accessible with low latency in multiple regions
	Create a global table in another region and set up 2 way replication between the tables
	Active-Active replication.. writes in one region are propogated everywhere	
	Upto 10 tables in 10 regions
	Users close to a specific region can access the data from table close to their region thereby helping with low latency

Amazon Redshift 
	Based on PostGreSQL but not used for OLTP
	Its OLAP (analytics and data warehousing)
	Analyzing data and making computations
	Load data every hour not every second
	10x performance better than other data warehouses
	Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
	Massively parallel Query execution 
	BI tools to integrate with it
	
Amazon EMR
	Elastic map reduce
	EMR helps Create hadoop cluster to analyze and process vast amounts of data
	The clusters can be made of 100's of EC2 instances that will be collaborating together to analyze your data	
	Also supports Apache Spark ,Hbase, Presto, Flink will be working on top of your hadoop cluster
	EMR takes care of provisioning and configuring these EC2 instances so they work and analyze data together from a hadoop perspective
	data processing, machine learning, web indexing, big data
