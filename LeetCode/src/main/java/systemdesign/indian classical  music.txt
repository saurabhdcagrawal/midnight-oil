Indian music is developed and organized into an intricate living organic system of raga(melody) and tal(rythm)
Based on the relationship between permanent individual base note called tonic with the successive notes
Thats why drone is played in the background to remind one Tonic/Base note "SA"
The grammar of melody and rythm is fixed however the skill and ingenuity of musician lies in his improvisation and creativity
specially in the invocation of mood and emotion of a particular raga
Indian music based on melody (one principal note and mood in a raga)
