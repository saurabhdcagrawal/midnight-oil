As we all know, primitives are pass by value and in no circumstance will they maintain their values.
So, we create a custom class which is a thin wrapper around an integer.

Finance basics

Wealth Management and Institutional Clients refer to different types of financial services
tailored to distinct groups of clients with varying needs.

Wealth management serves individuals (especially the wealthy) with personalized services
 for growing and protecting their wealth.
Institutional clients are organizations with large-scale investments and financial needs,
 and they require services focused on managing large portfolios and corporate-level strategies

1. Wealth Management
Wealth management refers to a set of financial services provided to individuals and
high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), typically focusing on growing, managing,
and preserving their wealth.
Wealth management often includes personalized advice, investments, tax planning,
estate planning, and retirement strategies.


Characteristics of Wealth Management:
Target Audience: High-net-worth individuals, families, or affluent individuals.
Services Provided:
Investment advisory services (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).
Tax planning, estate planning, and wealth preservation.
Retirement and financial planning.
Risk management and insurance.
Family office services (if applicable).
Customization: Highly personalized to the client's specific financial situation, goals, and preferences.
Focus: The primary focus is on individual wealth accumulation, preservation, and growth.
Example:
A wealthy individual seeking advice on investing their inherited estate, planning
for their children’s education, managing taxes, or preparing for retirement.

Example 1: Wealth Management
Client: John Doe, a wealthy individual

Situation: John, 45 years old, has an estate worth $10 million, including real estate,
stocks, and other investments. He is seeking advice on how to manage and grow his wealth,
especially since he wants to ensure his family is financially secure when he retires and when he passes away.

Services Provided:

Investment Strategy: John’s wealth manager will assess his current portfolio and suggest a diversified investment strategy based on his risk appetite, including stocks, bonds, and alternative assets like real estate and private equity.
Estate Planning: The wealth manager will help John set up a trust, ensuring his assets are passed on to his children in a tax-efficient manner, possibly reducing inheritance taxes.
Retirement Planning: Since John plans to retire in 20 years, his wealth manager will create a customized retirement plan to ensure a stable income during retirement, using a combination of investments and annuities.
Tax Management: The wealth manager will help John reduce tax liability through strategies like tax-loss harvesting and charitable giving.
In this case, John’s wealth manager is providing a highly personalized service tailored to John’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and family situation

Institutional clients refer to organizations or entities that invest large sums of money in the
financial markets, such as corporations, government agencies, pension funds, foundations, endowments,
and insurance companies.
These clients typically have complex investment needs and manage significant assets (often in billions).

Portfolio management for large-scale investments (stocks, bonds, private equity, real estate).
Asset allocation, risk management, and strategy development.
Corporate advisory services.
Trading and capital market services.
A pension fund seeking advice on managing its multi-billion-dollar portfolio or a
corporation managing its cash reserves and capital allocation.
Asset Allocation: The investment management firm will assess the pension fund’s needs and help
allocate the $5 billion across different asset classes—equities, bonds, real estate, private equity,
etc.—to achieve the right balance of risk and return.
Risk Management: The firm will design strategies to minimize risk, ensuring that the pension fund’s
portfolio can weather economic downturns without affecting its ability to pay pensions.
Advice tailored to meet the needs of large organizations, but less personal than WM clients
