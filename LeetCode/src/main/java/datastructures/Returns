Array questions and string questions are interchangeable?
Hashtable using balanced binary search tree?
Arraylist amortized inserion runtime is O(1)
Hash Table Collision Resolution (pg 636), Rabin-Karp Substring Search (pg 636)
String append ..every time a new string is created and copied over.. therefore if we are appending n strings.. run time is o(n2). Use string builder, 
it just appends and does not create a new character everytime
