Well defined API's

1. Statelessness

In a stateless API, the server does not remember client information between requests.
Every request carries all the information needed for the server to process it.
This makes APIs easier to scale horizontally because any server in the cluster can handle any request.

‚úÖ Example
GET /clients/123/analytics
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
The JWT carries authentication info ‚Üí server doesn‚Äôt keep sessions.

The JWT (JSON Web Token) contains all authentication and authorization data.
The server doesn‚Äôt store session state ‚Äî it only validates the token.
Scaling: if one server instance is busy or down, another can process the request without issue.
Works perfectly with load balancers and auto-scaling groups in cloud environments.

‚ùå Bad Stateful Example
The server uses session-based authentication, storing session data in memory.
If the client makes request #1 and the server assigns session ID X123, then request #2 must go to the same server (because that‚Äôs where the session lives).

‚ùå Stateful (In-Memory Sessions)
The server itself stores session data in memory.
Client gets a session ID like X123. (server usually sends in a cookie)
Client sends:
Cookie: sessionId=abc123
Server looks up abc123 ‚Üí finds { userId: 45, role: admin }.

3. What Happens on Subsequent Requests
For every new request:
The client sends back the session ID.
The server queries the session store ‚Üí fetches user data. (if there is a common session store)
Then applies authentication/authorization checks.
This means the server is holding the state of the session.

Multi‚Äëserver or cloud‚Äëscale app: You either need a shared session store (like Redis) or move to JWT for stateless auth.


On request #2, the client must hit the same server so it can find that session in memory.
If the load balancer sends the request to another server ‚Üí it won‚Äôt recognize X123.
This is why it‚Äôs considered bad for scalability.


 The problem is it doesn‚Äôt scale well in a load-balanced environment. That‚Äôs why JWT is better ‚Äî it removes the need for a session store by making the token itself carry the user‚Äôs identity and permissions."

Problems:

If that server crashes, the session is lost ‚Üí user forced to re-login.
Harder to scale across multiple regions or use a load balancer.
Inconsistent experience ‚Üí not acceptable for global APIs like L's Analytics API.

Business Impact
Statelessness reduces operational risk: no ‚Äústicky sessions,‚Äù so load can be distributed freely.
Improves resilience: if one server fails, requests keep flowing.
Simplifies compliance: tokens can carry signed claims (like user roles), reducing sensitive server-side storage.

üìå Why We Use Sessions
üîπ Without Sessions
Every time you make a request, the server would have no memory of you.

That means you‚Äôd have to send your username and password with every request.

This is insecure and inconvenient.

üîπ With Sessions
After you log in once:

The server verifies your credentials.

It creates a session (with your user ID, role, etc.) and stores it.

It gives you a session ID (in a cookie).

On each new request:

You send back the session ID.

The server looks up your session to know who you are and what you can do.

This way, you don‚Äôt need to log in every time, and you don‚Äôt expose your password repeatedly.

üîπ Why JWT Became Popular
Sessions require server‚Äëside storage.

JWT avoids that by embedding user info (claims) right in the token, so the server can authenticate you without looking up session data.

You still don‚Äôt have to log in on every request, but now the API stays stateless and scales better.

üé§ Interview Soundbite
"The main reason we use sessions is so users don‚Äôt have to log in on every request. Instead of sending credentials each time, the server creates a session after login and uses a session ID to identify the user. JWT takes this further ‚Äî it removes the need for a session store by letting the token itself carry the user‚Äôs identity, while still avoiding repeated logins."



‚ÄúFor APIs to be reliable and scalable, statelessness is key. I prefer token-based authentication like JWT, so each request carries its own context ‚Äî this way, the system can scale horizontally across AWS or Azure clusters without sticky sessions.


3. Versioning

APIs evolve. You‚Äôll need to add fields, change response formats, or deprecate old logic.
Without versioning, new changes can break existing clients.
Versioning provides a controlled way to deliver improvements while supporting backward compatibility.

‚úÖ Good Versioning Example
GET /v1/analytics
Returns riskScore as integer.

GET /v2/analytics
Returns enriched Json structure

Both /v1 and /v2 are supported for some time.
Clients can choose when to migrate.
Deprecation notices (in docs or response headers) warn clients when /v1 will be retired.

‚ùå Bad Non-Versioned Example
GET /analytics
Originally returned:
{
  "clientId": "123",
  "riskScore": 82
}

riskScore is an integer from 0‚Äì100.
Simple and works fine for early clients.


{
  "clientId": "123",
  "risk": {
    "score": 82,
    "category": "High",
    "confidence": 0.95
  },
  "lastUpdated": "2025-07-30T12:45:00Z"
}

Introduces a nested object for risk data.
Adds category (‚ÄúLow‚Äù, ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù, ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù) for readability.
Adds confidence score for more precision.
Adds lastUpdated timestamp for compliance traceability.

Existing clients parsing riskScore as an integer will break.
No safe migration path.

What you can do ?
With versioning:
/v1/analytics ‚Üí still returns simple integer score.
/v2/analytics ‚Üí returns the enriched structure.

Business Impact
Protects client trust: no sudden breakage of production systems.
Facilitates innovation: you can roll out new features in /v2 while /v1 keeps existing users happy.
Regulatory compliance: if a new law requires more fields (e.g., audit metadata), you add it in a new version without violating old contracts.


Similarly, versioning ensures backward compatibility. For example, I‚Äôd expose /v1 and /v2 endpoints, where /v2 introduces new analytics fields. This allows clients to migrate at their own pace while avoiding breaking existing integrations. At my current firm, we used this approach when normalizing compliance data from multiple providers.‚Äù


4) Documentation

Use Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive docs.
Provide request/response samples.
Sandbox (dev/qa environments) for testing:
https://sandbox.l.com/api/v1/analytics



5 Observability
APIs must be monitored for performance, errors, and usage.

‚úÖ Example
Logging: Log every request with a unique request ID for traceability.

Include timestamp, request path, response status codes, latency, and client ID. Avoid storing PII or financial data in logs
[2025-07-30T12:02:15Z] RequestId=abc123
Method=GET Path=/v2/analytics/123
Status=200 Latency=120ms ClientId=xyz789

If a client reports an issue, you can trace their exact request using the RequestId.

Metrics: latency, throughput, error rate. Collected in real time and exposed to tools like Prometheus.
Grafana dashboards display latency, error rates, and traffic volume.

Set alerts to identify issues proactively:
Alerts: if error rate > 5% in 1 min, trigger on call.
P99 latency >300ms ‚Üí warning alert.
No traffic detected for 5 minutes ‚Üí may indicate outage.


‚ÄúFor me, observability is crucial to ensuring API reliability. I log each request with a unique ID, status code, and latency while ensuring no PII is stored. For metrics, I expose latency, throughput, and error rate to Prometheus, and visualize them on Grafana dashboards. Alerts are configured, for example if error rate exceeds 5% in a minute, it triggers on‚Äëcall. In practice, this setup has allowed us to quickly detect anomalies ‚Äî like a sudden surge in 500 errors ‚Äî and resolve issues before they impacted clients or breached SLAs.‚Äù


6)  Error Handling & Transparency
When an API request fails, the client should know exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.
Without clear errors, clients struggle to debug, integration takes longer

For Analytics APIs (like L‚Äôs), transparency is especially critical since wrong or unclear responses could lead to financial losses or compliance breaches.

‚úÖ Good Error Handling Practices
1. Use Standard HTTP Status Codes
2xx ‚Üí Success (200 OK, 201 Created)
4xx ‚Üí Client Errors (400 Bad Request (invalid req format malformed json, user inout missing), 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 408 Request timeout)
5xx ‚Üí Server Errors (500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable)
This ensures consistency across APIs.

2. Return Structured Error Responses
Always respond with a predictable JSON structure (not plain text or HTML).

Example

{
  "errorCode": "INVALID_INPUT",
  "message": "Account ID must be 10 digits",
  "status": 400,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-30T14:15:00Z"
}


errorCode: matches HTTP code
A machine-friendly string or number clients can map to specific handling logic.

Example: "errorCode": "AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED"
errorMessage: human-readable message
traceId: helps correlate logs for debugging
details: optional context for developers

3. Provide Actionable Feedback
Errors shouldn‚Äôt just say what went wrong ‚Äî they should hint at how to fix it.
Example
{
  "status": "error",
  "errorCode": "400",
  "errorMessage": "Invalid date format",
  "details": "Expected format: YYYY-MM-DD"
}
A developer now knows exactly how to correct the request.

4. Avoid Leaking Sensitive Information
Never include stack traces or internal DB errors in client-facing messages.
Internal logs (linked via traceId) can have detailed error data for engineers, but not in client responses.
Avoid: "SQL Exception at line 45 in ClientDAO.java"

{
  "errorCode": "INVALID_INPUT",
  "message": "The client ID format is incorrect"
}

5. Transparency Through Traceability
Use a traceId for every request.
Clients can provide this ID in support tickets ‚Üí engineers instantly find the corresponding logs.
Example:
Support email: ‚ÄúRequest with traceId abc123 failed at 10:15 UTC.‚Äù
‚Üí Engineers search logs for abc123 to pinpoint the issue.

‚ùå Bad Error Handling Example
Request:

GET /clients/999/analytics
Response:
500 Internal Server Error

Problems:
Doesn‚Äôt explain if the client ID was invalid, the service was down, or the request was malformed.
Developer has no way to fix it.


üéØ Business Impact
Faster troubleshooting ‚Üí clients fix their issues without waiting for support.
Better reliability perception ‚Üí clients see clear, consistent messages instead of mysterious errors.
Compliance ‚Üí traceability helps auditors understand how errors were handled.

üîë How You Can Phrase It in Interview
‚ÄúFor me, error handling is about clarity and transparency. I always use standard HTTP status codes with structured JSON responses. For example, a 404 error in our sanctions API returns not just the code but a message like Client not found, a traceId for log correlation, and details such as the invalid client ID. This allows client developers to quickly resolve issues themselves and gives us an audit trail for compliance. What I avoid is returning generic 500 errors with no context, which leaves clients in the dark.



5. Performance & Scalability
An API must continue to perform reliably and quickly even as the number of requests or data volume grows.
Clients expect consistent response times whether you have 1,000 or 1,000,000 requests.
Scalability = ability to handle growth without degrading latency, reliability, or cost efficiency.

1. Pagination for Large Datasets
Returning thousands of records in one call is slow and heavy.

Instead, I return data in chunks with limit and offset or with cursors.

Example: A client requesting transaction history gets 100 records per page instead of all 50,000 at once.



üìå When Cursor Works Better than Offset
1. Large Datasets
Offset: offset=1000000 ‚Üí DB scans 1 million rows just to start.

Cursor: Starts from last known ID directly ‚Üí constant time.

Example: Paging through 50M client records in your AML system.


"An offset just tells the server to skip N rows, so if new records arrive, offsets shift and you risk duplicates or skips. A cursor uses a unique ID or timestamp from the last record served as a bookmark, so the next page always continues from the right spot ‚Äî even if the data changes in the meantime."
 Interview Soundbite
"In offset pagination, the client sends limit and offset each time. However, a well-designed API helps by providing pagination metadata in the response ‚Äî such as total records and the next offset ‚Äî so the client doesn‚Äôt need to calculate it manually. In high-volume scenarios, we sometimes prefer cursor-based pagination, where the server returns a cursor token for the client to use in the next request."

Instead of telling the server ‚Äúgive me page 3‚Äù or ‚Äústart at offset 100,‚Äù the server gives the client a ‚Äúcursor token‚Äù that marks where to continue.

The token usually encodes:

The last item‚Äôs unique ID or timestamp

Possibly some metadata (like sort order)

The client passes the token back to get the next ‚Äúpage.‚Äù





2. Caching with Redis (or Similar)

Some queries are very frequent (e.g., fetching a client‚Äôs risk profile).
Instead of hitting the database each time, cache results in memory.
Reduces latency (submillisecond responses) and DB load.

Example Flow
First request: API fetches data from DB ‚Üí stores in Redis with TTL (e.g., 5 minutes).
Subsequent requests: Served directly from Redis.





Common Cache Strategies for APIs
1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)
How it works:

Application checks cache first.

If data is missing, fetch from DB ‚Üí store in cache ‚Üí return to client.

Pros:

Simple and popular (e.g., with Redis).

Cache only stores what is requested (efficient).

Cons:

First request for missing data is slow (‚Äúcache miss‚Äù).

Example:
Client requests risk profile ‚Üí if not in Redis, fetch from DB2 ‚Üí cache for 5 minutes.

2. Read-Through Cache
How it works:

Application always reads through the cache layer.

Cache provider fetches from DB on misses automatically.

Pros:

Transparent to the application.

Consistent access path.

Cons:

More complex to set up.

3. Write-Through Cache
How it works:

Data is written to cache and DB at the same time.

Ensures cache and DB are always in sync.

Pros:

No stale data.

Reads are always fast.

Cons:

Slower writes (since 2 writes per operation).

Use Case:

Client preferences or analytics configs where reads must always reflect the latest state.

4. Write-Behind (Write-Back)
How it works:

Application writes to cache first.

Cache writes to DB asynchronously.

Pros:

Very fast writes.

Good for high-throughput systems.

Cons:

Risk of data loss if cache fails before DB write.

Harder to ensure durability.

5. Time-to-Live (TTL) / Expiration
How it works:

Cached items expire after a set period.

Ensures data freshness.

Example:

Cache analytics results for 5 minutes.

After TTL, fetch fresh data from DB.

6. Cache Invalidation Strategies
Manual Invalidation: Explicitly delete cache entries when underlying DB changes.

Write-through Invalidation: Update cache when DB is updated.

Versioning: Include a version number in cache keys so old data is ignored.

7. Content Delivery Network (CDN) Caching
How it works:

Useful for static or semi-static data.

Push data closer to global clients via CDN edge nodes.

Use Case:

Static financial reports, reference data (like country codes or currency rates).

üéØ How to Say It in Interview
‚ÄúFor performance, I‚Äôd use a cache-aside strategy with Redis for frequent queries ‚Äî the app checks the cache first, and only goes to the DB on a miss. To keep data fresh, I‚Äôd use TTLs of a few minutes for analytics results, since clients value up-to-date but fast responses. For critical configuration data, a write-through strategy ensures cache and DB stay in sync. I‚Äôd also set up invalidation triggers so updates in the DB reflect in the cache immediately. This approach balances speed, accuracy, and reliability, which is key in financial analytics APIs.‚Äù


1. Authentication & Authorization
Authentication ‚Üí Confirming who is calling the API.
Authorization ‚Üí Controlling what they can do.
Ensure only verified users or systems can access the API.
Use standards like OAuth2 (OAuth2 for delegated access (used in most enterprise APIs)) or JWT tokens (JWT tokens for stateless, signed identity checks.)
Example: A client must present a valid JWT before accessing /transactions/123. JWT stands for Json Web Token


But statelessness creates a challenge: how does the server know who‚Äôs calling it without a session?
OAuth 2.0 solves this by providing a secure, standardized way to authenticate and authorize clients.
Instead of passwords, clients use access tokens (often JWTs).
This keeps APIs stateless: each request includes the token with all the info the API needs.

3. JWT as the Access Token
The JWT payload carries claims like userId, role, and exp.
The signature ensures the token hasn‚Äôt been tampered with.
The API validates the JWT locally with a public key ‚Äî no need to query the auth server every time.

4. How It Strengthens API Security
Authentication ‚Üí Token proves who the caller is.
Authorization ‚Üí Claims like role control what they can access.
Statelessness ‚Üí Token carries all info, no server sessions needed.
Scalability ‚Üí Works across multiple microservices without a central session store.
Well‚ÄëDefined Errors ‚Üí If a token is expired or invalid, API returns 401 Unauthorized in a consistent format.



3. JWT as the Access Token
The JWT payload carries claims like userId, role, and exp.

The signature ensures the token hasn‚Äôt been tampered with.

The API validates the JWT locally with a public key ‚Äî no need to query the auth server every time.


JWTs can be issued by the same server or a separate authentication service. In smaller apps, the API server itself may issue them. But in large-scale financial systems like L, it‚Äôs typical to use a dedicated auth service. That server issues the JWT, and all other microservices just validate it ‚Äî which keeps authentication centralized, secure, and scalable
	
A JWT has three parts,seperated by dots: a header that describes the signing algorithm, a payload with claims like user ID, role, and expiry
(Claims are pieces of information about the user or client that are packaged inside the JWT payload.
They tell the API who the caller is and what they‚Äôre allowed to do), and a signature that proves the token hasn‚Äôt been tampered with. The header and payload are Base64 encoded, while the signature is created with a secret or private key of Auth server."

By Design, Payload Isn‚Äôt Encrypted The JWT payload is Base64 encoded, not encrypted.
That means anyone can decode it and see the claims.
This is intentional: JWT is about proof of authenticity, not secrecy.

2. Security Comes from the Signature
The important part is the signature.
Even if someone reads the payload, they can‚Äôt change it without invalidating the signature.

So the server knows the claims are authentic.

3. Sensitive Data Shouldn‚Äôt Go in Plain JWTs
Don‚Äôt store things like passwords or PII in the payload.
Only include claims needed for authorization (like userId, role, exp).

4. If Confidentiality is Needed
Use JWE (JSON Web Encryption), where the payload is encrypted as well as signed.
That way, only the intended recipient can read it.

The public key of auth server can be shared openly ‚Äî even clients can have it. But that doesn‚Äôt let them forge or modify tokens, because only the private key can generate a valid signature. If they try to change the payload, the signature check will fail. The only thing they can do is read the payload, which is why we avoid putting sensitive data in a plain JWT.The public key can only verify, not sign.

At L, an identity provider like Okta or a central auth service would issue the JWT signed with its private key. Each microservice ‚Äî say, the sanctions screening API ‚Äî has the corresponding public key. When a client calls /screenings/123 with a JWT, the screening service uses that public key to check the signature and trust the claims.

The auth server signs the JWT when it‚Äôs issued.
Other servers verify the signature locally using a known key.
No need to call back to the auth server for every request.
Because the JWT is digitally signed, the API trusts the content without checking back with the auth server.
Validation is fast (just cryptographic math).
Keeps the API stateless ‚Äî no session storage, no DB lookups.
Auth service issues a JWT when a compliance officer logs in.

The token includes claims like userId=456 and role=reviewer.
Each screening API (PEP, sanctions, adverse media) validates the JWT signature using the shared public key.
No round-trip to the auth server is needed.
"JWTs let APIs remain stateless because the token is signed by the auth server. Each microservice validates the signature locally using a public key, so it doesn‚Äôt need to call back to the auth server on every request. This way, we ensure both security and high performance at scale."

The key benefit is statelessness. Each API server can verify the token locally using a public key ‚Äî no need to query the auth server or database on every request. That makes it fast and scalable

OAuth 2.0 is the framework for getting and using access tokens, while JWT is a format for the tokens themselves. In many systems, OAuth 2.0 issues JWTs as access tokens. OAuth defines the process ‚Äî who issues tokens, how they‚Äôre refreshed, and what scopes they carry ‚Äî and JWT provides the actual signed token that the resource server can verify without contacting the auth server."

üìå OAuth 2.0 Example (Simple)
‚ÄúImagine you want to use a fitness app that shows your Google Calendar workouts. Instead of giving the fitness app your Google password, the app redirects you to Google‚Äôs login page. You log in there, and Google gives the app an access token with permission to read your calendar. The fitness app then calls Google Calendar‚Äôs API with that token. Google checks the token, and if it‚Äôs valid, it returns your workout events. This way, the fitness app never sees your Google password ‚Äî only a token.

Similarly can we extend it to normal auth server and resource server in 1 application
 you can absolutely extend that fitness app example to a normal single application where the auth server and the resource server are part of the same system. That‚Äôs actually very common in enterprise setups.

üìå OAuth 2.0 in a Single Application
User Logs In
User enters their credentials on the app‚Äôs login page.
The app routes this to its auth server module (could even be part of the same backend).
Auth Server Issues Access Token
After verifying credentials, the auth component issues an access token (often a JWT).

Client Uses Token
The app uses this token for all subsequent API calls to its own backend (the resource server).
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Resource Server Validates Token
The backend validates the JWT locally (checking the signature, expiry, and claims like role).

‚úÖ Why Use OAuth 2.0 Even in a Single App
Statelessness ‚Üí no server session storage needed.
Scalability ‚Üí multiple microservices in the same app can trust the token without sharing session data.
Future‚Äëproofing ‚Üí if you later split services or add third‚Äëparty integrations, the token model already works.

Example in Plain Words
"Even in a single app, we can separate the auth logic from the data APIs. The auth part issues a token once the user logs in, and the rest of the app‚Äôs APIs just validate that token before serving data. This keeps the system stateless and scalable, and it‚Äôs easy to extend later if we add more services."



2. Encrypt All Data in Transit
Always enforce HTTPS so credentials and data aren‚Äôt exposed.
Example: Even simple GET requests go over TLS to prevent man‚Äëin‚Äëthe‚Äëmiddle attacks.
Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., account numbers, PII).

3)Strict Input Validation & Sanitization
Request Validation
Schemas for validating incoming requests and structured error responses for validation errors.
Protect against injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
Whitelist expected values, reject malformed inputs.
Never trust client input blindly.
Example: Ensure clientId is strictly numeric and within expected length before querying DB2.

I add rate limiting to prevent abuse, apply least‚Äëprivilege access, and ensure every request is logged for audits. Errors are handled gracefully without exposing system details. In financial services, I see security not as a feature but as a baseline requirement for trust and compliance."



Rate Limiting & Throttling
Why
Prevents abuse from a single client overwhelming the system.

Ensures fair usage among multiple clients.

Protects backend from sudden request floods (accidental or malicious).

Example Behavior
If a client makes more than 100 requests/minute:

http
Copy
Edit
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60
Real‚ÄëWorld Case
In compliance APIs, without rate limits, one rogue client could spike traffic and delay onboarding checks for thousands of other clients.

4. Horizontal Scaling with Stateless Services
Make APIs stateless so they can be deployed behind a load balancer.
This is done with load balancers and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
APIs should handle sudden traffic spikes by adding more servers instead of overloading one.

This is done with load balancers and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

Example: If millions of records come in at market open, auto‚Äëscaling ensures the system stays fast and reliable.

5. Asynchronous Processing
For heavy workloads (e.g., running analytics on 10M records), accept the request and process asynchronously.

Return a Job ID ‚Üí client polls for completion.

Example

http
Copy
Edit
POST /analytics/jobs
{
  "portfolioId": "XYZ"
}
Response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "jobId": "abc123",
  "status": "processing"
}
üéØ Business Impact
Better client experience: consistent low latency.

Regulatory reliability: ensures compliance checks complete on time even under heavy load.

Cost efficiency: caching + rate limiting avoid unnecessary infra spend.

üîë How to Say It in Interview
‚ÄúFor me, performance and scalability mean ensuring the API responds quickly and reliably under any load. I‚Äôd use pagination so clients never fetch massive datasets in one call, caching with Redis for frequent queries, and rate limiting to protect from traffic spikes. In fact, I implemented Redis caching in a sanctions screening API, which cut average latency by more than 30%. I‚Äôd also design the services stateless so they can scale horizontally in AWS or Azure, and use asynchronous processing for heavy workloads. This ensures our clients get fast responses without compromising stability.‚Äù

‚ö° Do you want me to also give you a Good vs Bad comparison table for Performance & Scalability (so you can glance at it before the interview to refresh)?



Consistency & Clear resource modeling, uniform resource naming

‚ÄúAPIs should be consistent and easy to use. I follow the same style across all endpoints ‚Äî using plural nouns, lowercase, and hyphens ‚Äî so developers always know what to expect. For example, instead of writing something like /GetClientDetails, I‚Äôd design it as /clients/123. Endpoints should represent resources rather than actions, with HTTP methods showing what to do. So, GET /clients/123 fetches a client, while POST /clients creates a new one. This approach keeps the API simple, predictable, and intuitive.

Always use {id} style for identifiers, not query strings unless filtering.

Example:

‚úÖ /clients/{id}

‚úÖ /clients/{id}/accounts/{accountId}

‚ùå /getClient?id=123

"I always use {id} in the path when referring to a specific resource ‚Äî for example, /clients/123. Matches the idea of a resource in the URL path.
Query strings are better for filters or optional parameters, like /clients?status=active&limit=50. This makes the API cleaner, more RESTful, and easier to use.Here, you‚Äôre asking for a list of resources, filtered by conditions.


Idempotency

Idempotency in APIs
üîπ What It Means
An operation is idempotent if doing it once or many times has the same effect.

GET requests ‚Üí naturally idempotent (reading data doesn‚Äôt change it).

PUT requests ‚Üí should be idempotent (updating the same resource with the same data doesn‚Äôt change the result).

DELETE requests ‚Üí idempotent (deleting a resource once or multiple times leaves it gone).

POST requests ‚Üí usually not idempotent (creating new resources creates duplicates).

üîπ Why It Matters
Reliability: Clients or network layers may retry requests if they fail.

Safety: Ensures retries don‚Äôt accidentally cause duplicate charges, orders, or updates.

Predictability: Makes APIs easier to reason about.

üîπ Example 1 ‚Äî Idempotent PUT
http
Copy
Edit
PUT /clients/123/address
{
  "address": "123 Main Street"
}
Calling this once or 10 times ‚Üí client 123 still has address ‚Äú123 Main Street.‚Äù

üîπ Example 2 ‚Äî Non‚ÄëIdempotent POST
http
Copy
Edit
POST /payments
{
  "amount": 100,
  "accountId": 456
}
Each call creates a new payment ‚Üí 10 calls = 10 payments.

üîπ How to Make POST Idempotent (When Needed)
Use an idempotency key (unique identifier) in the request header:

http
Copy
Edit
POST /payments
Idempotency-Key: abc123
{
  "amount": 100,
  "accountId": 456
}
If the same key is used again, the server recognizes the duplicate and only processes it once.

üé§ Interview Soundbite
"Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once. For example, a PUT to update a client‚Äôs address is idempotent, but a POST to create a payment is not. Idempotency is important because clients or intermediaries may retry requests on failure, and we don‚Äôt want that to cause duplicates. For operations like payments, we can use an idempotency key to ensure the request is only processed once."

ASYNC PROCESSING OF HEAVY ANALYTICS JOBS
Some analytics tasks are too heavy for synchronous HTTP calls (<200 ms).

Example: Running risk analysis on 10M client transactions.

Solution:

API accepts request ‚Üí enqueues job in Kafka.

Returns immediately with jobId.

Worker services consume the event from Kafka ‚Üí process data asynchronously.

Client polls /analytics/jobs/{jobId} for results.

REAL‚ÄëTIME STREAMING ANALYTICS

When client portfolios update frequently (e.g., stock trades, market events).

Kafka streams changes in real time to analytics microservices.

Ensures risk scores are always up‚Äëto‚Äëdate without clients polling constantly.

INTEGRATING WITH MULTIPLE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS

One event ‚Üí multiple consumers.

Example: A sanctions screening result might go to:

Compliance dashboard

Audit logging system

Alerting service

Kafka lets you fan out the same event to multiple systems reliably.

ENSURING RELIABILITY & REPLAYABILITY

Kafka stores events durably ‚Üí consumers can replay events if needed.

Useful in compliance (audit trails) and fault recovery.

Example: If the analytics service is down, it can later catch up from Kafka.

EXAMPLE FLOW IN OUR DESIGN
Client submits a batch risk analysis request.

API Gateway validates JWT, stores request.

Analytics Microservice publishes event ‚Üí Kafka Topic ‚Äúrisk.jobs‚Äù.

Worker microservices consume from ‚Äúrisk.jobs‚Äù ‚Üí run analysis asynchronously.

Results stored in distributed DB + Redis.

Client polls GET /v1/analytics/jobs/{jobId} or gets notified via webhook.

INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"I‚Äôd integrate Kafka as an event bus to handle asynchronous and real‚Äëtime analytics. For example, when a client requests a large batch risk analysis, the request is placed on a Kafka topic. Worker services consume it, process the data, and store the results. This keeps the API response time low while ensuring reliability, scalability, and auditability. Kafka also supports real‚Äëtime updates, so our risk scores stay fresh as new market events stream in."

‚ö° Saurabh ‚Äî do you want me to insert this Kafka Event Bus section directly into the Performance & Scalability part of your master notes (maybe under ‚ÄúAsynchronous Processing‚Äù) so your document shows how async + real‚Äëtime messaging fit into your analytics API?

You said:
whats a webhook


ChatGPT said:
Great follow‚Äëup üëç ‚Äî because in the Kafka/async context I just gave, webhooks are the alternative to clients polling for results.
Here‚Äôs the Notepad‚Äëfriendly explanation for your notes:

WEBHOOKS
WHAT IS A WEBHOOK?
A webhook is a way for one system to send real‚Äëtime notifications to another system over HTTP.

Instead of the client polling the API repeatedly ‚Üí the API pushes data to the client when something happens.

It‚Äôs essentially an HTTP callback:

You give the API a URL (your webhook endpoint).

When the event occurs, the API makes an HTTP POST to that URL with the event payload.

WHEN TO USE WEBHOOKS IN OUR ANALYTICS API
ASYNC JOB COMPLETION

Client submits a heavy risk analysis job.

Instead of polling /analytics/jobs/{jobId}, the API calls the client‚Äôs webhook when the job finishes.

REAL‚ÄëTIME ALERTING

Notify compliance officers when:

A client is flagged in a sanctions list.

A risk score crosses a threshold.

Webhook instantly pushes the alert payload.

INTEGRATION WITH EXTERNAL SYSTEMS

External partners (banks, regulators) can subscribe via webhooks.

Example: Regulator gets notified immediately when a high‚Äërisk client is detected.

EXAMPLE FLOW
Client registers webhook URL:
POST /v1/webhooks
{ "url": "https://clientapp.com/alerts" }

Later, when an event occurs (e.g., risk job completed), API sends:
POST https://clientapp.com/alerts
Payload:
{
"event": "RISK_JOB_COMPLETED",
"jobId": "abc123",
"status": "success",
"timestamp": "2025-07-31T12:15:00Z"
}

Client‚Äôs system processes the event without polling.

BENEFITS
Reduces client polling ‚Üí saves bandwidth and improves latency.

Real‚Äëtime updates ‚Üí instant user experience.

Decouples systems ‚Üí API doesn‚Äôt need to manage state per client.

CHALLENGES & BEST PRACTICES
Security: Sign webhook payloads with HMAC so clients can verify authenticity.

Retries: If client‚Äôs endpoint is down, retry with exponential backoff.

Idempotency: Include unique event IDs so duplicate notifications aren‚Äôt processed twice.

Logging: Store webhook delivery attempts for audit/compliance.

INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"A webhook is essentially an HTTP callback where our API notifies a client system when an event occurs. In our analytics API, instead of polling for risk job results, a client could provide a webhook URL, and we‚Äôd POST the results when the job completes. This provides real‚Äëtime updates, reduces polling overhead, and integrates smoothly with client workflows."

‚ö° Question for you, Saurabh: do you want me to also show how webhooks and Kafka work together in your design (Kafka for internal async processing ‚Üí webhook for client notifications), so you have a complete end‚Äëto‚Äëend async story in your notes?







You said:
so its about processing time, not large payloads to return/


ChatGPT said:
Exactly üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôve got it right.

Webhooks (and Kafka in our earlier discussion) are mainly about handling processing time and event-driven updates, not about reducing the payload size. Let me make this clear for your notes:

WEBHOOKS: WHY WE USE THEM
NOT FOR:

Large payload delivery. (You can still send a webhook with a payload of any size, though typically it‚Äôs a small JSON body.)

MAINLY FOR:

Asynchronous Processing (Long Jobs)

When a job takes too long for a synchronous HTTP response (e.g., analyzing millions of transactions).

Instead of making the client wait, you:

Accept the request.

Process it in the background.

Notify the client via webhook when it‚Äôs ready.

Real-Time Notifications

Push alerts immediately when an event happens (e.g., client flagged in sanctions list).

Avoids client having to poll the API every few seconds.

Event-Driven Integrations

Trigger downstream workflows in client systems without them initiating a call.

Example: Webhook tells a partner bank system, ‚ÄúNew high-risk client detected.‚Äù

EXAMPLE IN OUR ANALYTICS API
A client requests a portfolio risk analysis involving 10M trades.

Too heavy to respond in <200 ms.

API responds: { "jobId": "abc123", "status": "processing" }.

When done, API POSTs to client‚Äôs webhook:
{
"event": "PORTFOLIO_ANALYSIS_READY",
"jobId": "abc123",
"status": "completed",
"resultUrl": "https://api.globalanalytics.com/jobs/abc123/results"
}

SUMMARY
Webhooks are about WHEN to return data, not HOW MUCH.

They solve the long processing time problem and deliver real-time notifications.

If payload is huge, you typically send a result link in the webhook, not the entire data inline.

‚ö° So: It‚Äôs about processing time and event-driven triggers ‚Äî not payload size.

Do you want me to also show you how to combine webhooks + a result download link (for large analytics results) in your notes ‚Äî so you‚Äôre covered for both long jobs and large payloads in interviews?







You said:
how are webhooks implemented


ChatGPT said:
Great question üëç ‚Äî because interviewers often dig into not just what a webhook is, but how you would implement it in a real system.
I‚Äôll give you a Notepad‚Äëfriendly breakdown that you can integrate into your notes.

IMPLEMENTING WEBHOOKS
STEP 1: CLIENT REGISTERS A WEBHOOK URL

API exposes an endpoint to let clients register where they want to receive callbacks.

Example:
POST /v1/webhooks
{
"url": "https://clientapp.com/alerts",
"eventTypes": ["RISK_JOB_COMPLETED", "HIGH_RISK_ALERT"]
}

Server stores webhook details securely (DB table: webhookId, clientId, url, eventTypes).

STEP 2: TRIGGER EVENTS IN THE API

When a relevant event occurs (e.g., a risk analysis job completes):

Analytics microservice generates event.

Event published to Kafka or internal queue.

Webhook Dispatcher service picks it up.

STEP 3: SEND THE WEBHOOK REQUEST

Webhook Dispatcher sends an HTTPS POST request to the client‚Äôs registered URL.

Example POST payload:
{
"event": "RISK_JOB_COMPLETED",
"jobId": "abc123",
"status": "success",
"timestamp": "2025-07-31T14:00:00Z",
"traceId": "xyz789",
"resultUrl": "https://api.globalanalytics.com/jobs/abc123/results"
}

Content-Type: application/json

Include HMAC signature header so the client can verify authenticity.

Example: X-Signature: sha256=abcd1234...

STEP 4: CLIENT RECEIVES & HANDLES WEBHOOK

Client must implement a public HTTPS endpoint to receive webhooks.

Validates:

Signature (ensures it really came from our API).

Content-Type = application/json.

Processes payload and acknowledges receipt with HTTP 200.

STEP 5: RETRY STRATEGY (IMPORTANT)

If the client‚Äôs endpoint fails or times out:

Retry delivery with exponential backoff.

Log failures for audit.

Stop retries after a max time (e.g., 24 hours) ‚Üí mark webhook as failed.

STEP 6: IDEMPOTENCY

Include a unique eventId in each webhook payload.

If client accidentally processes the same webhook twice, they can ignore duplicates.

                                  HTTP 200
BEST PRACTICES
Use HTTPS for all webhook calls.

Sign payloads with HMAC (using client‚Äôs secret key).

Don‚Äôt include sensitive PII directly; use a secure resultUrl if payload is large.

Retry on failure with exponential backoff.

Provide clients a test endpoint so they can validate integration.

INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"I‚Äôd implement webhooks by letting clients register a callback URL, then having a dispatcher service send HTTPS POST requests with signed payloads whenever events occur. We‚Äôd use HMAC signatures for authenticity, retries with exponential backoff for reliability, and idempotency keys to avoid duplicate processing. For large results, the webhook would contain a secure resultUrl rather than the entire dataset."

‚ö° Saurabh ‚Äî do you want me to also give you a Java Spring Boot code snippet (for both sending and receiving a webhook) so you can include an actual implementation example in your notes?







You said:

ChatGPT said:
Perfect üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs add a practical Spring Boot example for your notes showing both sides of a webhook:

How our Analytics API sends a webhook

How a client receives and processes a webhook

This will make your notes really interview‚Äëready.

1. SENDING A WEBHOOK (Analytics API Side)
java
Copy
import org.springframework.http.HttpEntity;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.util.Base64;

public class WebhookSender {

    private static final String SECRET = "client-secret-key"; // Shared secret for HMAC
    private final RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    public void sendWebhook(String url, String payload) throws Exception {
        // Compute HMAC signature
        Mac sha256_HMAC = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(SECRET.getBytes(), "HmacSHA256");
        sha256_HMAC.init(secretKey);
        String signature = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(sha256_HMAC.doFinal(payload.getBytes()));

        // Set headers
        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);
        headers.add("X-Signature", signature);

        // Send POST request
        HttpEntity<String> request = new HttpEntity<>(payload, headers);
        restTemplate.postForEntity(url, request, String.class);
    }
}
Usage Example

java
Copy
String payload = "{ \"event\":\"RISK_JOB_COMPLETED\", \"jobId\":\"abc123\" }";
new WebhookSender().sendWebhook("https://clientapp.com/alerts", payload);
2. RECEIVING A WEBHOOK (Client Side)

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.util.Base64;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/alerts")
public class WebhookReceiver {

    private static final String SECRET = "client-secret-key"; // Must match sender's

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<String> receiveWebhook(@RequestBody String payload,
                                                 @RequestHeader("X-Signature") String signature) {
        try {
            // Verify HMAC signature
            Mac sha256_HMAC = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
            SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(SECRET.getBytes(), "HmacSHA256");
            sha256_HMAC.init(secretKey);
            String expectedSignature = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(sha256_HMAC.doFinal(payload.getBytes()));

            if (!expectedSignature.equals(signature)) {
                return new ResponseEntity<>("Invalid signature", HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
            }

            // Process payload
            System.out.println("Received Webhook: " + payload);

            return new ResponseEntity<>("Received", HttpStatus.OK);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            return new ResponseEntity<>("Error processing webhook", HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        }
    }
}
FLOW SUMMARY
Analytics API finishes a long job (e.g., batch risk analysis).

It builds a JSON payload and computes an HMAC signature with a shared secret.

It POSTs the payload to the client‚Äôs webhook URL with X-Signature header.

The Client Webhook Endpoint verifies the signature ‚Üí ensures authenticity.

If valid ‚Üí processes payload and returns HTTP 200.

If fails ‚Üí API retries with exponential backoff.

‚ö° INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"In our analytics API, long‚Äërunning jobs trigger a webhook via an internal dispatcher service. The payload is signed with HMAC and sent as an HTTP POST. Clients expose a secure endpoint that verifies the signature before processing. This way, they get real‚Äëtime notifications without polling, and we maintain integrity and reliability."

Do you want me to also show how this webhook dispatcher would integrate with Kafka (so events are pushed to Kafka first, then consumed and delivered as webhooks) ‚Äî that would tie together your async design story?







You said:
dont understand this POST /v1/webhooks
{
"url": "https://clientapp.com/alerts",
"eventTypes": ["RISK_JOB_COMPLETED", "HIGH_RISK_ALERT"]
}


ChatGPT said:
No problem üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs break that down clearly in your context, because it‚Äôs a very common pattern in webhook‚Äëbased API designs and can seem confusing the first time you see it.

What does
bash
Copy
POST /v1/webhooks
{
  "url": "https://clientapp.com/alerts",
  "eventTypes": ["RISK_JOB_COMPLETED", "HIGH_RISK_ALERT"]
}
mean?

This is the client telling your Analytics API where and what it wants to be notified about.
Think of it as a subscription request.

Step‚Äëby‚ÄëStep Explanation
Endpoint:
POST /v1/webhooks ‚Üí This is the API endpoint you (the provider) expose to allow clients to register a webhook.

Request Body:

"url": "https://clientapp.com/alerts"
‚Üí The client provides a URL where they want you to send the webhook notifications.
‚Üí This is their callback endpoint (they must host it).

"eventTypes": ["RISK_JOB_COMPLETED", "HIGH_RISK_ALERT"]
‚Üí The client chooses which types of events they care about.
‚Üí Example:

RISK_JOB_COMPLETED ‚Üí notify when their analytics job finishes.

HIGH_RISK_ALERT ‚Üí notify when a client‚Äôs risk crosses a threshold.

Your Server Stores This Info:

In your DB, you now store:

clientId

webhook URL

event types they subscribed to

maybe a shared secret for signing requests

Later, When Event Occurs:

Suppose a client‚Äôs batch risk analysis completes.

Your API checks: Does this client have a webhook registered for RISK_JOB_COMPLETED?

If yes ‚Üí POST to the client‚Äôs URL:

json
Copy
{
  "event": "RISK_JOB_COMPLETED",
  "jobId": "abc123",
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-31T14:00:00Z",
  "resultUrl": "https://api.globalanalytics.com/jobs/abc123/results"
}
Client Receives Notification Automatically

Their app immediately gets the POST and processes it.

No need for them to poll your API asking "is my job done yet?".

Analogy
Think of it like signing up for SMS alerts:

You give your phone number (url) and tell the bank ‚Äútext me when my balance goes low or salary credited‚Äù (eventTypes).

After that, you don‚Äôt keep calling the bank ‚Äî they just text you when it happens.

‚ö° INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"We let clients register their own webhook endpoints by POSTing a URL and the events they care about. When those events occur, our system automatically POSTs a signed payload to their endpoint. This replaces polling with real‚Äëtime notifications, improving efficiency and client experience."

üëâ Do you want me to show you what the DB schema for storing registered webhooks looks like (so you can explain how you manage multiple clients‚Äô webhook subscriptions)?







You said:
otify when their analytics job finishes. -- their as in requested by them but done by provider?


ChatGPT said:
Exactly üëç ‚Äî you‚Äôve nailed the subtlety here.

When I wrote:

‚Äúnotify when their analytics job finishes‚Äù

the ‚Äútheir‚Äù means:

The client requested the analytics job (through your API).

The provider (your API) runs the job on its systems.

When the job is completed, the provider notifies the client via the webhook they registered.

So:

Ownership: The request belongs to the client.

Execution: The processing happens on your (the provider‚Äôs) infrastructure.

Notification: When done, the result (or a result link) is pushed back to the client‚Äôs system.

Example in Context
Client (a bank compliance officer) calls:

bash
Copy
POST /v1/analytics/batch
{
  "clientIds": ["12345", "67890"]
}
Your Analytics API responds immediately:

json
Copy
{
  "jobId": "abc123",
  "status": "processing"
}
Processing happens asynchronously inside your system (maybe via Kafka workers).

When job completes, your system triggers the webhook (because the client subscribed earlier):
POST to https://clientapp.com/alerts

json
Copy
{
  "event": "RISK_JOB_COMPLETED",
  "jobId": "abc123",
  "status": "success",
  "resultUrl": "https://api.globalanalytics.com/jobs/abc123/results"
}
So the client gets real‚Äëtime notification for the job they requested, without having to poll your API repeatedly.

Interview Soundbite
"In our API, a client may submit a long‚Äërunning analytics job. While the processing happens on our backend, we notify the client via their registered webhook when the job finishes. This ensures they get real‚Äëtime updates for the work they initiated, without constant polling."
