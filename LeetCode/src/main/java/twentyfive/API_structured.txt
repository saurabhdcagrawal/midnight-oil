# WELL-DEFINED API PRINCIPLES

A well-defined API is reliable, scalable, secure, and easy to use. Below are the core principles, structured for clarity, with detailed subheaders and example-driven guidance.

******************************1) STATELESSNESS***************************************************************************************

## EXPLANATION

In a stateless API, the server does not remember client information between requests.
Every request carries all the information needed for the server to process it.
This makes APIs easier to scale horizontally because any server in the cluster can handle any request.

## GOOD EXAMPLE

GET /clients/123/analytics
Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

* The JWT carries authentication info → server doesn’t keep sessions.
* The JWT (JSON Web Token) contains all authentication and authorization data.
* The server doesn’t store session state — it only validates the token.
* Scaling: if one server instance is busy or down, another can process the request without issue.
* Works perfectly with load balancers and auto-scaling groups in cloud environments.

## BAD STATEFUL EXAMPLE

The server uses session-based authentication, storing session data in memory.
If the client makes request #1 and the server assigns session ID X123, then request #2 must go to the same server (because that’s where the session lives).

## STATEFUL (IN-MEMORY SESSIONS)

* The server itself stores session data in memory.
* Client gets a session ID like X123. (server usually sends in a cookie)
* Client sends:
  Cookie: sessionId=abc123
* Server looks up abc123 → finds { userId: 45, role: admin }.

## WHAT HAPPENS ON SUBSEQUENT REQUESTS

For every new request:

* The client sends back the session ID.
* The server queries the session store → fetches user data. (if there is a common session store)
* Then applies authentication/authorization checks.
  This means the server is holding the state of the session.

In a multi-server or cloud-scale app:

* You either need a shared session store (like Redis)
* Or move to JWT for stateless auth.

On request #2, the client must hit the same server so it can find that session in memory.
If the load balancer sends the request to another server → it won’t recognize X123.
This is why it’s considered bad for scalability.

## THE PROBLEM

The problem is it doesn’t scale well in a load-balanced environment.
That’s why JWT is better — it removes the need for a session store by making the token itself carry the user’s identity and permissions.

## PROBLEMS

* If that server crashes, the session is lost → user forced to re-login.
* Harder to scale across multiple regions or use a load balancer.
* Inconsistent experience → not acceptable for global APIs like L's Analytics API.

## BUSINESS IMPACT

* Statelessness reduces operational risk: no “sticky sessions,” so load can be distributed freely.
* Improves resilience: if one server fails, requests keep flowing.
* Simplifies compliance: tokens can carry signed claims (like user roles), reducing sensitive server-side storage.

## WHY WE USE SESSIONS

WITHOUT SESSIONS

* Every time you make a request, the server would have no memory of you.
* That means you’d have to send your username and password with every request.
* This is insecure and inconvenient.

WITH SESSIONS

* After you log in once:

  * The server verifies your credentials.
  * It creates a session (with your user ID, role, etc.) and stores it.
  * It gives you a session ID (in a cookie).
* On each new request:

  * You send back the session ID.
  * The server looks up your session to know who you are and what you can do.
* This way, you don’t need to log in every time, and you don’t expose your password repeatedly.

## WHY JWT BECAME POPULAR

* Sessions require server‑side storage.
* JWT avoids that by embedding user info (claims) right in the token, so the server can authenticate you without looking up session data.
* You still don’t have to log in on every request, but now the API stays stateless and scales better.

## INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE

"The main reason we use sessions is so users don’t have to log in on every request. Instead of sending credentials each time, the server creates a session after login and uses a session ID to identify the user. JWT takes this further — it removes the need for a session store by letting the token itself carry the user’s identity, while still avoiding repeated logins."

"For APIs to be reliable and scalable, statelessness is key. I prefer token-based authentication like JWT, so each request carries its own context — this way, the system can scale horizontally across AWS or Azure clusters without sticky sessions."


***************************************************2) AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION************************************************************

## OVERVIEW

* Authentication → Confirming who is calling the API.
* Authorization → Controlling what they can do.
* Ensure only verified users or systems can access the API.
* Use standards like OAuth2 (for delegated access in most enterprise APIs) or JWT tokens (for stateless, signed identity checks).
* Example: A client must present a valid JWT before accessing /transactions/123. JWT stands for JSON Web Token.

## THE CHALLENGE

Statelessness creates a challenge: how does the server know who’s calling it without a session?
OAuth 2.0 solves this by providing a secure, standardized way to authenticate and authorize clients.
Instead of passwords, clients use access tokens (often JWTs).
This keeps APIs stateless: each request includes the token with all the info the API needs.

## JWT AS THE ACCESS TOKEN

1. The JWT payload carries claims like userId, role, and exp.
2. The signature ensures the token hasn’t been tampered with.
3. The API validates the JWT locally with a public key — no need to query the auth server every time.

## HOW IT STRENGTHENS API SECURITY

* Authentication → Token proves who the caller is.
* Authorization → Claims like role control what they can access.
* Statelessness → Token carries all info, no server sessions needed.
* Scalability → Works across multiple microservices without a central session store.
* Well‑Defined Errors → If a token is expired or invalid, API returns 401 Unauthorized in a consistent format.

## JWT STRUCTURE

A JWT has three parts, separated by dots:

* Header: describes the signing algorithm.
* Payload: contains claims such as user ID, role, and expiry.
* Signature: proves the token hasn’t been tampered with.

The header and payload are Base64 encoded.
The signature is created with a secret or private key of the Auth server.

## BY DESIGN, PAYLOAD ISN’T ENCRYPTED

* The JWT payload is Base64 encoded, not encrypted.
* Anyone can decode it and see the claims.
* This is intentional: JWT is about proof of authenticity, not secrecy.

## SECURITY COMES FROM THE SIGNATURE

* Even if someone reads the payload, they can’t change it without invalidating the signature.
* The server knows the claims are authentic.

## SENSITIVE DATA SHOULD NOT GO IN PLAIN JWTs

* Don’t store things like passwords or PII in the payload.
* Only include claims needed for authorization (like userId, role, exp).

## IF CONFIDENTIALITY IS NEEDED

* Use JWE (JSON Web Encryption), where the payload is encrypted as well as signed.
* Only the intended recipient can read it.

## PUBLIC AND PRIVATE KEYS

* The public key of the auth server can be shared openly — even with clients.
* But only the private key can generate a valid signature.
* If someone tries to change the payload, the signature check will fail.
* Therefore, the public key can only verify, not sign.

## HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE

* At large firms, an identity provider like Okta or a central auth service issues the JWT signed with its private key.
* Each microservice (e.g., sanctions screening API) has the corresponding public key.
* When a client calls /screenings/123 with a JWT, the screening service uses the public key to verify the signature and trust the claims.

The auth server signs the JWT when it’s issued.
Other servers verify the signature locally using the known public key.
No need to call back to the auth server for every request.
Because the JWT is digitally signed, the API trusts the content without checking back.
Validation is fast (cryptographic math).
Keeps the API stateless — no session storage, no DB lookups.

## OAUTH 2.0 EXAMPLE (SIMPLE)

Imagine you want to use a fitness app that shows your Google Calendar workouts.
Instead of giving the fitness app your Google password, the app redirects you to Google’s login page.
You log in there, and Google gives the app an access token with permission to read your calendar.
The fitness app then calls Google Calendar’s API with that token.
Google checks the token, and if it’s valid, it returns your workout events.
This way, the fitness app never sees your Google password — only a token.

## OAUTH 2.0 IN A SINGLE APPLICATION

* User Logs In: User enters their credentials on the app’s login page.
* The app routes this to its auth server module (could even be part of the same backend).
* Auth Server Issues Access Token: After verifying credentials, the auth component issues an access token (often a JWT).
* Client Uses Token: The app uses this token for all subsequent API calls to its own backend (the resource server).
* Authorization: Bearer <token>.
* Resource Server Validates Token: The backend validates the JWT locally (checking the signature, expiry, and claims like role).

## WHY USE OAUTH 2.0 EVEN IN A SINGLE APP

* Statelessness → no server session storage needed.
* Scalability → multiple microservices in the same app can trust the token without sharing session data.
* Future‑proofing → if you later split services or add third‑party integrations, the token model already works.

## EXAMPLE IN PLAIN WORDS

"Even in a single app, we can separate the auth logic from the data APIs. The auth part issues a token once the user logs in, and the rest of the app’s APIs just validate that token before serving data. This keeps the system stateless and scalable, and it’s easy to extend later if we add more services."


*******************************************************3)SECURITY*********************************************

## ENCRYPT ALL DATA IN TRANSIT

* Always enforce HTTPS so credentials and data aren’t exposed.
* Example: Even simple GET requests go over TLS to prevent man‑in‑the‑middle attacks.
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., account numbers, PII).

## STRICT INPUT VALIDATION & SANITIZATION

REQUEST VALIDATION

* Use schemas or annotations for validating incoming requests.
* Every API request body (often JSON) should be checked against a predefined structure before your server processes it.
* Ensures required fields are present, types are correct, and no unexpected or malicious data sneaks in.
* Provide structured error responses for validation errors.
* Protect against injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS).
* Whitelist expected values, reject malformed inputs.
* Never trust client input blindly.

EXAMPLE WITHOUT SCHEMA VALIDATION
Client sends:
{
"clientId": "12345",
"riskScore": "eighty-two"
}

Here riskScore is a string ("eighty-two") instead of an integer.
Without schema validation, this could break your system logic or allow injection.

EXAMPLE WITH SCHEMA VALIDATION (JSON SCHEMA)
Define a schema:
{
"type": "object",
"properties": {
"clientId": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^\[0-9]{5}\$" },
"riskScore": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 100 }
},
"required": \["clientId", "riskScore"],
"additionalProperties": false
}

What this enforces:

* clientId must be a string of exactly 5 digits.
* riskScore must be an integer between 0 and 100.
* Both fields are required.
* No extra unexpected fields allowed.

If the incoming request doesn’t match this schema → API returns a 400 Bad Request with a helpful error message.

WHY THIS MATTERS

* Security → prevents SQL injection, XSS, or unexpected data from sneaking in.
* Reliability → ensures your code only processes well-formed requests.
* Developer Experience → clients get clear, consistent errors when they send invalid data.

---

## VALIDATION APPROACHES IN JAVA / SPRING BOOT

1. SPRING BOOT BEAN VALIDATION (BUILT-IN, RECOMMENDED)

* Uses Jakarta Bean Validation (JSR‑380).
* Add annotations on DTO fields like @NotNull, @Pattern, @Size, @Min, @Max.
* If request invalid → Spring automatically returns 400 Bad Request with error details.

Example DTO:
public class ClientRequest {
@NotNull
@Pattern(regexp = "^\[0-9]{5}\$", message = "clientId must be 5 digits")
private String clientId;

```
@NotNull
@Min(value = 0, message = "riskScore must be between 0 and 100")
@Max(value = 100, message = "riskScore must be between 0 and 100")
private Integer riskScore;
// getters and setters
```

}

Example Controller:
@PostMapping("/validate")
public ResponseEntity<String> validateClient(@Valid @RequestBody ClientRequest request) {
return ResponseEntity.ok("Valid request for client " + request.getClientId());
}

* Pros: Simple, integrated with Spring, automatic error handling.
* Cons: Less flexible for dynamic payloads.

---

2. JSON SCHEMA VALIDATION (FOR DYNAMIC PAYLOADS)

* Use libraries like NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator.
* Validates incoming JSON against a schema definition.
* Enforces field presence, data types, formats, and rejects unexpected properties.

Example Schema:
{
"type": "object",
"properties": {
"clientId": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^\[0-9]{5}\$" },
"riskScore": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 100 }
},
"required": \["clientId", "riskScore"],
"additionalProperties": false
}

Example Java Validation Snippet:
JsonSchema schema = factory.getSchema(schemaString);
JsonNode jsonNode = mapper.readTree(jsonPayload);
Set<ValidationMessage> errors = schema.validate(jsonNode);
if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
throw new RuntimeException("Invalid request: " + errors);
}

* Pros: Very flexible, supports external schema contracts, strong validation.
* Cons: More complex to set up, slightly more overhead.

---

## ADDITIONAL SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

* Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse.
* Use least privilege access for API keys and tokens.
* Log every request for audits without storing sensitive PII.
* Avoid exposing stack traces or internal system details in errors.
* Protect against replay attacks using nonces or timestamps in tokens.


*************************************************************3 VERSIONING***********************************************************************

## WHY IT MATTERS

APIs evolve. You’ll need to add fields, change response formats, or deprecate old logic.
Without versioning, new changes can break existing clients.
Versioning provides a controlled way to deliver improvements while supporting backward compatibility.

## GOOD VERSIONING EXAMPLE

GET /v1/analytics

* Returns riskScore as integer.

GET /v2/analytics

* Returns enriched JSON structure.

Both /v1 and /v2 are supported for some time.
Clients can choose when to migrate.
Deprecation notices (in docs or response headers) warn clients when /v1 will be retired.

## BAD NON-VERSIONED EXAMPLE

GET /analytics

Originally returned:
{
"clientId": "123",
"riskScore": 82
}

* riskScore is an integer from 0–100.
* Simple and works fine for early clients.

Later changed to:
{
"clientId": "123",
"risk": {
"score": 82,
"category": "High",
"confidence": 0.95
},
"lastUpdated": "2025-07-30T12:45:00Z"
}

* Introduces a nested object for risk data.
* Adds category (“Low”, “Medium”, “High”) for readability.
* Adds confidence score for more precision.
* Adds lastUpdated timestamp for compliance traceability.

## EXISTING CLIENT IMPACT

* Existing clients parsing riskScore as an integer will break.
* No safe migration path.

## WHAT YOU CAN DO

With versioning:

* /v1/analytics → still returns simple integer score.
* /v2/analytics → returns the enriched structure.

## BUSINESS IMPACT

* Protects client trust: no sudden breakage of production systems.
* Facilitates innovation: you can roll out new features in /v2 while /v1 keeps existing users happy.
* Regulatory compliance: if a new law requires more fields (e.g., audit metadata), you add it in a new version without violating old contracts.

## INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE

"Similarly, versioning ensures backward compatibility. For example, I’d expose /v1 and /v2 endpoints, where /v2 introduces new analytics fields. This allows clients to migrate at their own pace while avoiding breaking existing integrations. At my current firm, we used this approach when normalizing compliance data from multiple providers."


****************************************************************4) DOCUMENTATION***********************************************************

* Use Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive docs.
* Provide request/response samples.
* Sandbox (dev/qa environments) for testing:
  [https://sandbox.l.com/api/v1/analytics](https://sandbox.l.com/api/v1/analytics)

---

****************************************************************5) OBSERVABILITY****************************************************************

APIs must be monitored for performance, errors, and usage.

## LOGGING

* Log every request with a unique request ID for traceability.
* Include timestamp, request path, response status codes, latency, and client ID.
* Avoid storing PII or financial data in logs.

Example:
\[2025-07-30T12:02:15Z] RequestId=abc123
Method=GET Path=/v2/analytics/123
Status=200 Latency=120ms ClientId=xyz789

If a client reports an issue, you can trace their exact request using the RequestId.

## METRICS

* Latency, throughput, error rate.
* Collected in real time and exposed to tools like Prometheus.
* Grafana dashboards display latency, error rates, and traffic volume.

## ALERTS

* If error rate > 5% in 1 min, trigger on call.
* P99 latency >300ms → warning alert.
* No traffic detected for 5 minutes → may indicate outage.

## INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE

"For me, observability is crucial to ensuring API reliability. I log each request with a unique ID, status code, and latency while ensuring no PII is stored. For metrics, I expose latency, throughput, and error rate to Prometheus, and visualize them on Grafana dashboards. Alerts are configured, for example if error rate exceeds 5% in a minute, it triggers on‑call. In practice, this setup has allowed us to quickly detect anomalies — like a sudden surge in 500 errors — and resolve issues before they impacted clients or breached SLAs."

---

**********************************************************6) ERROR HANDLING & TRANSPARENCY****************************************************

When an API request fails, the client should know exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.
Without clear errors, clients struggle to debug and integration takes longer.

For Analytics APIs (like L’s), transparency is especially critical since wrong or unclear responses could lead to financial losses or compliance breaches.

## GOOD ERROR HANDLING PRACTICES

1. Use Standard HTTP Status Codes

* 2xx → Success (200 OK, 201 Created)
* 4xx → Client Errors (400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 408 Request Timeout)
* 5xx → Server Errors (500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable)

2. Return Structured Error Responses
   Example:
   {
   "errorCode": "INVALID\_INPUT",
   "message": "Account ID must be 10 digits",
   "status": 400,
   "timestamp": "2025-07-30T14:15:00Z"
   }

* errorCode: matches HTTP code
* errorMessage: human-readable message
* traceId: helps correlate logs for debugging
* details: optional context for developers

3. Provide Actionable Feedback
   Example:
   {
   "status": "error",
   "errorCode": "400",
   "errorMessage": "Invalid date format",
   "details": "Expected format: YYYY-MM-DD"
   }

4. Avoid Leaking Sensitive Information
   Never include stack traces or internal DB errors in client-facing messages.

5. Transparency Through Traceability
   Use a traceId for every request.
   Clients can provide this ID in support tickets → engineers instantly find the corresponding logs.

## BAD ERROR HANDLING EXAMPLE

Request: GET /clients/999/analytics
Response: 500 Internal Server Error

Problems:

* Doesn’t explain if the client ID was invalid, the service was down, or the request was malformed.
* Developer has no way to fix it.

## BUSINESS IMPACT

* Faster troubleshooting → clients fix their issues without waiting for support.
* Better reliability perception.
* Compliance → traceability helps auditors understand how errors were handled.

## INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE

"For me, error handling is about clarity and transparency. I always use standard HTTP status codes with structured JSON responses. For example, a 404 error in our sanctions API returns not just the code but a message like Client not found, a traceId for log correlation, and details such as the invalid client ID. This allows client developers to quickly resolve issues themselves and gives us an audit trail for compliance. What I avoid is returning generic 500 errors with no context, which leaves clients in the dark."

---


******************************************************7) PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY*************************************************************

An API must continue to perform reliably and quickly even as the number of requests or data volume grows.
Clients expect consistent response times whether you have 1,000 or 1,000,000 requests.
Scalability = ability to handle growth without degrading latency, reliability, or cost efficiency.

1. PAGINATION FOR LARGE DATASETS

---

* Returning thousands of records in one call is slow and heavy.
* Instead, return data in chunks with limit and offset or with cursors.

EXAMPLE: A client requesting transaction history gets 100 records per page instead of all 50,000 at once.

WHEN CURSOR WORKS BETTER THAN OFFSET

* Large Datasets: Offset = offset=1000000 → DB scans 1 million rows just to start.
* Cursor: Starts from last known ID directly → constant time.
* Example: Paging through 50M client records in your AML system.
* Prevents duplicates or skips if new records arrive.

EXPLANATION:

* An offset just tells the server to skip N rows. If new records arrive, offsets shift and you risk duplicates or skips.
* A cursor uses a unique ID or timestamp from the last record served as a bookmark, so the next page always continues from the right spot.

INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"In offset pagination, the client sends limit and offset each time. However, a well-designed API helps by providing pagination metadata in the response — such as total records and the next offset — so the client doesn’t need to calculate it manually. In high-volume scenarios, we sometimes prefer cursor-based pagination, where the server returns a cursor token for the client to use in the next request."

---

2. CACHING WITH REDIS (OR SIMILAR)

---

Some queries are very frequent (e.g., fetching a client’s risk profile).
Instead of hitting the database each time, cache results in memory.
Reduces latency (submillisecond responses) and DB load.

EXAMPLE FLOW

* First request: API fetches data from DB → stores in Redis with TTL (e.g., 5 minutes).
* Subsequent requests: Served directly from Redis.

## COMMON CACHE STRATEGIES FOR APIs

CACHE-ASIDE (LAZY LOADING)

* How it works: Application checks cache first. If data missing, fetch from DB → store in cache → return to client.
* Pros: Simple and popular (e.g., with Redis). Efficient since cache only stores what is requested.
* Cons: First request for missing data is slow (cache miss).
* Example: Client requests risk profile → if not in Redis, fetch from DB2 → cache for 5 minutes.

READ-THROUGH CACHE

* How it works: Application always reads through the cache layer. Cache provider fetches from DB on misses automatically.
* Pros: Transparent to the application. Consistent access path.
* Cons: More complex to set up.

WRITE-THROUGH CACHE

* How it works: Data is written to cache and DB at the same time.
* Pros: Cache and DB always in sync. Reads always fast.
* Cons: Slower writes (2 writes per operation).
* Use Case: Client preferences or analytics configs where reads must always reflect latest state.

WRITE-BEHIND (WRITE-BACK)

* How it works: Application writes to cache first. Cache writes to DB asynchronously.
* Pros: Very fast writes. Good for high-throughput systems.
* Cons: Risk of data loss if cache fails before DB write. Harder to ensure durability.

TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) / EXPIRATION

* How it works: Cached items expire after a set period. Ensures data freshness.
* Example: Cache analytics results for 5 minutes. After TTL, fetch fresh data from DB.

CACHE INVALIDATION STRATEGIES

* Manual Invalidation: Explicitly delete cache entries when underlying DB changes.
* Write-through Invalidation: Update cache when DB is updated.
* Versioning: Include a version number in cache keys so old data is ignored.

CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORK (CDN) CACHING

* How it works: Useful for static or semi-static data. Push data closer to global clients via CDN edge nodes.
* Use Case: Static financial reports, reference data (like country codes or currency rates).

INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"For performance, I’d use a cache-aside strategy with Redis for frequent queries — the app checks the cache first, and only goes to the DB on a miss. To keep data fresh, I’d use TTLs of a few minutes for analytics results, since clients value up-to-date but fast responses. For critical configuration data, a write-through strategy ensures cache and DB stay in sync. I’d also set up invalidation triggers so updates in the DB reflect in the cache immediately. This approach balances speed, accuracy, and reliability, which is key in financial analytics APIs."

---

3. RATE LIMITING & THROTTLING

---

WHY

* Prevents abuse from a single client overwhelming the system.
* Ensures fair usage among multiple clients.
* Protects backend from sudden request floods (accidental or malicious).

EXAMPLE BEHAVIOR
If a client makes more than 100 requests/minute:
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 60

REAL-WORLD CASE
In compliance APIs, without rate limits, one rogue client could spike traffic and delay onboarding checks for thousands of other clients.

---

4. HORIZONTAL SCALING WITH STATELESS SERVICES

---

* Make APIs stateless so they can be deployed behind a load balancer.
* Done with load balancers and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
* APIs should handle sudden traffic spikes by adding more servers instead of overloading one.

EXAMPLE
If millions of records come in at market open, auto-scaling ensures the system stays fast and reliable.

---

5. ASYNCHRONOUS PROCESSING

---

For heavy workloads (e.g., running analytics on 10M records), accept the request and process asynchronously.
Return a Job ID → client polls for completion.

EXAMPLE
POST /analytics/jobs
{ "portfolioId": "XYZ" }

Response:
{ "jobId": "abc123", "status": "processing" }

## BUSINESS IMPACT

* Better client experience: consistent low latency.
* Regulatory reliability: ensures compliance checks complete on time even under heavy load.
* Cost efficiency: caching + rate limiting avoid unnecessary infra spend.

## INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE

"For me, performance and scalability mean ensuring the API responds quickly and reliably under any load. I’d use pagination so clients never fetch massive datasets in one call, caching with Redis for frequent queries, and rate limiting to protect from traffic spikes. In fact, I implemented Redis caching in a sanctions screening API, which cut average latency by more than 30%. I’d also design the services stateless so they can scale horizontally in AWS or Azure, and use asynchronous processing for heavy workloads. This ensures our clients get fast responses without compromising stability."


***************************************CONSISTENCY & RESOURCE MODELING*****************************************************************************

APIs should be consistent and easy to use.

* Follow the same style across all endpoints — plural nouns, lowercase, hyphens.
* Endpoints represent resources, not actions.

## EXAMPLES

GOOD
/clients/{id}
/clients/{id}/accounts/{accountId}

BAD
/getClient?id=123

Query strings are better for filters or optional parameters, like:
/clients?status=active\&limit=50

This makes the API cleaner, more RESTful, and easier to use.

---

*************************************************************9) IDEMPOTENCY********************************************************************

## WHAT IT MEANS

An operation is idempotent if doing it once or many times has the same effect.

* GET → naturally idempotent (reading data doesn’t change it).
* PUT → idempotent (updating the same resource with the same data doesn’t change the result).
* DELETE → idempotent (deleting a resource once or multiple times leaves it gone).
* POST → usually not idempotent (creating new resources creates duplicates).

EXAMPLE 1: IDEMPOTENT PUT
PUT /clients/123/address
{ "address": "123 Main Street" }
Calling this once or 10 times → client 123 still has address “123 Main Street.”

EXAMPLE 2: NON-IDEMPOTENT POST
POST /payments
{ "amount": 100, "accountId": 456 }
Each call creates a new payment → 10 calls = 10 payments.

HOW TO MAKE POST IDEMPOTENT (WHEN NEEDED)
Use an idempotency key in the request header:
POST /payments
Idempotency-Key: abc123
{ "amount": 100, "accountId": 456 }
If the same key is used again, the server recognizes the duplicate and only processes it once.

## INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE

"Idempotency means that making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once. For example, a PUT to update a client’s address is idempotent, but a POST to create a payment is not. Idempotency is important because clients or intermediaries may retry requests on failure, and we don’t want that to cause duplicates. For operations like payments, we can use an idempotency key to ensure the request is only processed once."




************************NEW TOPICS**************************


Here’s a high-level system design diagram for the analytics API you can use in your L hiring manager interview.

It shows:

Clients connecting via an API Gateway

Backend Microservices (Spring Boot)

Kafka Event Bus for async, real-time messaging

DB2 + Redis as the persistence + caching layers

Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) for observability

⚡ Would you like me to also give you a 2‑minute spoken explanation (a “pitch”) you can memorize for this diagram, so you sound crisp in the interview? 


Principles of Well-Defined APIs
1. Consistency
Follow clear, predictable patterns in resource naming, endpoints, and responses.

Example: /clients/{id}/accounts → plural nouns, consistent structure.

2. Clear Resource Modeling
Model endpoints around business entities/resources.

Avoid verb-heavy URIs (/getClientInfo ❌ vs /clients/{id} ✅).

3. Statelessness
Each request should contain all the information needed (especially in REST).

No reliance on server-side sessions for state.

4. Idempotency
Repeated requests (like retries) should not cause unintended side effects.

Example: PUT and DELETE should be idempotent.

5. Versioning
Support backward compatibility as APIs evolve.

Common pattern: /v1/clients → /v2/clients.

6. Error Handling & Standardized Responses
Use standard HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 404, 500).

Include helpful error bodies:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "errorCode": "INVALID_INPUT", "message": "Account ID is invalid" }
7. Performance & Scalability
Support pagination (limit, offset) for large result sets.

Implement caching headers or layers (like Redis).

Ensure APIs are horizontally scalable.

8. Security
Always enforce authentication & authorization (OAuth2, JWT).

Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

Encrypt sensitive data in transit (HTTPS).

9. Documentation & Discoverability
Provide OpenAPI/Swagger specs.

Include usage examples, request/response schemas, and error codes.

# GLOBAL FINANCIAL ANALYTICS API DESIGN

## OBJECTIVE

Provide a secure, globally available, low‑latency API for financial analytics such as risk scores, compliance checks, and portfolio metrics.

---

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

Functional:

* Real‑time analytics: client risk scores, portfolio risk, compliance insights.
* Support batch queries for multiple clients.
* Provide historical analytics with pagination.
* Health check endpoint for monitoring.

Non‑Functional:

* Response time under 200 ms globally.
* High availability (99.99%).
* Stateless, horizontally scalable.
* Fully secure with OAuth 2.0 / JWT.
* Region‑aware compliance (GDPR, etc.).
* Fully observable with traceability.

---

## ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

* **Global Load Balancer** routes clients to the nearest healthy region (US, EU, APAC).
* **Regional Clusters** host stateless microservices for analytics.
* **Auth Server / Identity Provider** issues JWTs for secure authentication.
* **API Gateway in each region**:

  * Validates JWT with Auth Server’s public key.
  * Applies rate limiting & input validation.
* **Redis Cache**: stores frequently accessed data (risk profiles, reference metrics).
* **Distributed Database (Aurora Global / Spanner)**:

  * Strong consistency for financial transactions.
  * Regional partitioning for compliance (e.g., EU data stays in EU).
* **Cold Storage (S3/Blob)**: stores historical analytics and audit logs.

---

## REQUEST FLOW

1. Client logs in to Auth Server → receives JWT signed with private key.
2. Client sends request to API Gateway with JWT:
   Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
3. API Gateway validates JWT locally using Auth Server’s public key.
4. If valid: forwards request to regional Analytics Microservice.
5. Microservice checks Redis cache.

   * Cache hit → returns data instantly.
   * Cache miss → queries Distributed DB.
6. DB response stored in Redis (TTL‑based).
7. Microservice returns JSON response with traceId for observability.

---

## ENDPOINT DESIGN

1. GET Client Risk Score
   GET /v1/analytics/clients/{clientId}/risk

* Returns risk score, category, confidence, lastUpdated.

2. GET Portfolio Risk Score
   GET /v1/analytics/portfolios/{portfolioId}/risk

* Aggregates client risk scores, volatility, exposure breakdown.

3. GET Batch Analytics
   POST /v1/analytics/batch

* Accepts list of clientIds.
* Returns array of risk scores with metadata.

4. GET Historical Analytics (Paginated)
   GET /v1/analytics/clients/{clientId}/history?cursor=xyz\&limit=100

* Cursor‑based pagination for large datasets.

5. GET Health Check
   GET /v1/analytics/health

* Returns service status, uptime, and dependency health.

---

## DATA LAYER

* **Distributed Database**: Aurora Global, Spanner, or Cosmos DB.

  * Multi‑region deployment.
  * Strong consistency for compliance data.
  * Region partitioning for GDPR and residency laws.
* **Redis Cache**:

  * Cache‑Aside strategy for hot queries (e.g., risk scores).
  * TTL for freshness.
  * Invalidation when DB updates occur.
* **Cold Storage**:

  * Historical analytics, long‑term compliance logs.

---

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

* **Redis Caching** for low‑latency repeated queries.
* **Cursor Pagination** instead of offset for large datasets.
* **Pre‑computed Aggregates** updated via Kafka pipelines for heavy analytics.
* **gRPC for internal service‑to‑service calls** within regional clusters.
* **Horizontal Scaling**: Kubernetes auto‑scales microservices.
* **Asynchronous Processing**: batch jobs return jobId → client polls for completion.

---

## SECURITY

* OAuth 2.0 with JWTs signed by Auth Server.
* JWT includes userId, role, scopes, and expiry.
* API Gateway validates JWT locally with public key.
* TLS enforced for all endpoints.
* Input validation via:

  * Bean Validation (Spring Boot) for DTOs.
  * JSON Schema for dynamic payloads.
* Rate limiting and quotas applied at the API Gateway.
* Audit logs with traceId → compliance tracking.

---

## ERROR HANDLING

Structured JSON error response:
{
"errorCode": "INVALID\_INPUT",
"message": "Client ID must be 10 digits",
"status": 400,
"traceId": "abc123",
"timestamp": "2025-07-31T12:45:00Z"
}

HTTP Codes:

* 200 OK → Success
* 400 Bad Request → Invalid input
* 401 Unauthorized → Invalid/expired JWT
* 404 Not Found → Resource missing
* 429 Too Many Requests → Rate limit exceeded
* 500 Internal Server Error → Server issue

---

## OBSERVABILITY

* Logs every request with requestId, clientId, status, latency.
* Prometheus metrics: latency, error rate, throughput, cache hit ratio.
* Grafana dashboards for visualization.
* Alerts if:

  * Error rate > 5% in 1 min.
  * P99 latency > 300 ms.
  * No traffic in a region for 5 min.

---

## RATE LIMITING & QUOTAS

* Free Tier: 1000 requests/day.
* Premium Tier: 1M requests/day.
* Exceeding quota → HTTP 429 Too Many Requests with Retry‑After header.

## INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE

"I’d design the Analytics API as part of a global, stateless architecture deployed across US, EU, and APAC with distributed databases and Redis caching. Clients authenticate via an Auth Server that issues JWTs. Each request is routed by a global load balancer to the nearest regional cluster, where the API Gateway validates the JWT and applies rate limiting. Microservices fetch data from Redis or the distributed DB, ensuring <200 ms latency. Pre‑computed aggregates and asynchronous processing handle heavy analytics, while observability is achieved via Prometheus and Grafana. This setup provides security, compliance, and scalability for a global financial system."


Yes 👍 I can make your notes Notepad‑friendly right now. I’ll take all the content you pasted and just rearrange it neatly under ASCII/UPPERCASE headers — without deleting anything. Here’s the organized version you can paste directly into Notepad:

```
========================================================
KAFKA EVENT BUS FOR ASYNC, REAL-TIME MESSAGING
========================================================

WHAT IT IS
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform.
Works as a pub/sub event bus → producers publish events, consumers subscribe and process them.
Events are persisted in Kafka topics for durability and replay.
Enables decoupled, asynchronous, realtime communication between services.


WHEN TO USE IN OUR ANALYTICS API
- ASYNC PROCESSING OF HEAVY ANALYTICS JOBS
- REAL‑TIME STREAMING ANALYTICS
- INTEGRATING WITH MULTIPLE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS
- ENSURING RELIABILITY & REPLAYABILITY


ASYNC PROCESSING OF HEAVY ANALYTICS JOBS
Some analytics tasks are too heavy for synchronous HTTP calls (<200 ms).
Example: Running risk analysis on 10M client transactions.

Solution:
- API accepts request → enqueues job in Kafka.
- Returns immediately with jobId.
- Worker services consume the event from Kafka → process data asynchronously.
- Client polls /analytics/jobs/{jobId} for results.


REAL‑TIME STREAMING ANALYTICS
- When client portfolios update frequently (e.g., stock trades, market events).
- Kafka streams changes in real time to analytics microservices.
- Ensures risk scores are always up‑to‑date without clients polling constantly.


INTEGRATING WITH MULTIPLE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS
One event → multiple consumers.

Example: A sanctions screening result might go to:
- Compliance dashboard
- Audit logging system
- Alerting service

Kafka lets you fan out the same event to multiple systems reliably.


ENSURING RELIABILITY & REPLAYABILITY
- Kafka stores events durably → consumers can replay events if needed.
- Useful in compliance (audit trails) and fault recovery.
- Example: If the analytics service is down, it can later catch up from Kafka.


EXAMPLE FLOW IN OUR DESIGN
- Client submits a batch risk analysis request.
- API Gateway validates JWT, stores request.
- Analytics Microservice publishes event → Kafka Topic “risk.jobs”.
- Worker microservices consume from “risk.jobs” → run analysis asynchronously.
- Results stored in distributed DB + Redis.
- Client polls GET /v1/analytics/jobs/{jobId} or gets notified via webhook.

INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"I’d integrate Kafka as an event bus to handle asynchronous and real‑time analytics. For example, when a client requests a large batch risk analysis, the request is placed on a Kafka topic. Worker services consume it, process the data, and store the results. This keeps the API response time low while ensuring reliability, scalability, and auditability. Kafka also supports real‑time updates, so our risk scores stay fresh as new market events stream in."


========================================================
WEBHOOKS
========================================================

WHAT IS A WEBHOOK?
A webhook is a way for one system to send real-time notifications to another system over HTTP.(instead of Kafka)

Instead of the client polling the API repeatedly → the API pushes data to the client when something happens.

It’s essentially an HTTP callback:
- The clients give the API a URL (your webhook endpoint).
- When the event occurs, the API makes an HTTP POST to that URL with the event payload.


WHEN TO USE WEBHOOKS IN OUR ANALYTICS API
- ASYNC JOB COMPLETION
- REAL TIME ALERTING
- INTEGRATION WITH EXTERNAL SYSTEMS


ASYNC JOB COMPLETION
Client submits a heavy risk analysis job.
Instead of polling /analytics/jobs/{jobId}, the API calls the client’s webhook when the job finishes.


REAL-TIME ALERTING
Notify compliance officers when:
- A client is flagged in a sanctions list.
- A risk score crosses a threshold.

Webhook instantly pushes the alert payload.


INTEGRATION WITH EXTERNAL SYSTEMS	
External partners (banks, regulators) can subscribe via webhooks.
Example: Regulator gets notified immediately when a high‑risk client is detected.


EXAMPLE FLOW
Client registers webhook URL:
POST /v1/webhooks
{
"url": "https://clientapp.com/alerts"
}

Later, when an event occurs (e.g., risk job completed), API sends:
POST https://clientapp.com/alerts
Payload:
{
"event": "RISK_JOB_COMPLETED",
"jobId": "abc123",
"status": "success",
"timestamp": "2025-07-31T12:15:00Z"
}


BENEFITS
- Reduces client polling → saves bandwidth and improves latency.
- Real‑time updates → instant user experience.
- Decouples systems → API doesn’t need to manage state per client.


CHALLENGES & BEST PRACTICES
- Security: Sign webhook payloads with HMAC so clients can verify authenticity.
- Retries: If client’s endpoint is down, retry with exponential backoff.
- Idempotency: Include unique event IDs so duplicate notifications aren’t processed twice.
- Logging: Store webhook delivery attempts for audit/compliance.


WEBHOOKS: WHY WE USE THEM
NOT FOR:
- Large payload delivery.

MAINLY FOR:
- Asynchronous Processing (Long Jobs)
- Real-Time Notifications
- Event-Driven Integrations


EXAMPLE IN OUR ANALYTICS API
A client requests a portfolio risk analysis involving 10M trades.

API responds: { "jobId": "abc123", "status": "processing" }.

When done, API POSTs to client’s webhook:
{
"event": "PORTFOLIO_ANALYSIS_READY",
"jobId": "abc123",
"status": "completed",
"resultUrl": "https://api.globalanalytics.com/jobs/abc123/results"
}

SUMMARY
Webhooks are about WHEN to return data, not HOW MUCH.


========================================================
IMPLEMENTING WEBHOOKS
========================================================

STEP 1: CLIENT REGISTERS A WEBHOOK URL
POST /v1/webhooks
{
"url": "https://clientapp.com/alerts",
"eventTypes": ["RISK_JOB_COMPLETED", "HIGH_RISK_ALERT"]
}


STEP 2: TRIGGER EVENTS IN THE API
- Analytics microservice generates event.
- Event published to Kafka or internal queue.
- Webhook Dispatcher service picks it up.


STEP 3: SEND THE WEBHOOK REQUEST
Webhook Dispatcher sends HTTPS POST to client’s registered URL.

Payload Example:
{
"event": "RISK_JOB_COMPLETED",
"jobId": "abc123",
"status": "success",
"timestamp": "2025-07-31T14:00:00Z",
"traceId": "xyz789",
"resultUrl": "https://api.globalanalytics.com/jobs/abc123/results"
}


STEP 4: CLIENT RECEIVES & HANDLES WEBHOOK
- Client implements HTTPS endpoint.
- Validates signature + Content-Type.
- Processes payload and replies HTTP 200.


STEP 5: RETRY STRATEGY
- Retry with exponential backoff if failure.
- Log failures for audit.
- Stop after max retries.


STEP 6: IDEMPOTENCY
- Include unique eventId in payload.
- Prevents duplicate processing.

                                  HTTP 200


BEST PRACTICES
- Use HTTPS
- Sign payloads with HMAC
- Don’t include sensitive PII directly; use resultUrl
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Provide test endpoints for clients


========================================================

FLOW SUMMARY
- Analytics API finishes job.
- Builds JSON payload + HMAC signature.
- Sends POST to client webhook URL.
- Client verifies signature, processes payload, replies 200.
- API retries on failure.


INTERVIEW SOUNDBITE
"In our analytics API, long‑running jobs trigger a webhook via an internal dispatcher service. The payload is signed with HMAC and sent as an HTTP POST. Clients expose a secure endpoint that verifies the signature before processing. This way, they get real‑time notifications without polling, and we maintain integrity and reliability."

******************************************************

Hi, I’m Saurabh Agrawal. I’m a senior backend developer in the Financial Crimes Technology group at Morgan Stanley, where I build scalable, secure Java-based microservices for sanctions, adverse media, and politically exposed person (PEP) screening. My work ensures compliance with global AML regulations by screening millions of client records across wealth management and institutional portfolios, generating about 35,000 alerts each month. These systems help the firm proactively identify high-risk entities and block transactions that could pose reputational or regulatory risks.

I specialize in building high-performance services using Java 17, Spring Boot, and Kafka. My expertise includes both synchronous and asynchronous microservices, REST and SOAP APIs, DB2, MQ, and cloud technologies, often integrating with compliance platforms like Actimize and RCM. I focus on making systems fault-tolerant, highly observable, and secure, which is critical in regulated environments.

One of my most impactful projects was redesigning our batch screening platform to handle over 50 million client records. I used Spring Batch and Kafka to parallelize workloads and added robust monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus. This reduced processing time by 40%, cleared alert backlogs, and improved SLA adherence. Another key initiative I led was automating our Enhanced Due Diligence workflow. I replaced a fragile RPA-based setup with a Kafka-driven microservice that processes triggers in real time, integrates audit logging, and improves SLA compliance. This reduced manual steps by 75% and cut average case turnaround time by more than 30%.

Previously, I worked in Wealth Management Technology on the Data Quality Platform for home loans. I designed event-driven microservices to reconcile and validate credit and mortgage data for CCAR stress loss testing, improving data accuracy and timeliness for risk models.

Across these roles, I’ve consistently taken ownership of design and delivery. For example, in the batch screening re-architecture, I mentored junior developers on Kafka streaming patterns and performance trade-offs, and in the EDD automation, I partnered closely with compliance stakeholders to align workflows with regulatory expectations.

For my next role, I’m looking to step into a broader senior position where I can contribute not only as a developer but also as an architect and mentor. I want to help design scalable, cloud-native solutions in financial services or fintech, continuing to solve complex problems while driving innovation in financial crime detection, payments screening, and compliance technology.

					STAR Story — Performance & Scalability

Q: Can you tell me about a time you improved the performance of a large-scale system?

S: In our Financial Crimes Technology group at Morgan Stanley, we process around 8 million client records monthly for sanctions, PEP, and adverse media screening. The legacy batch screening system couldn’t handle the increasing volume, especially as onboarding surged.
T: I needed to redesign the system to handle over 50 million records while meeting strict compliance SLAs.
A: I re-architected the platform using Spring Batch and Kafka, partitioning workloads for parallel processing. I optimized DB2 queries, implemented fault tolerance with retries and checkpointing, and added observability with Prometheus and Grafana to track performance and failures.
R: Processing time dropped by 40%, alert backlogs were cleared, and SLA adherence improved significantly. The new design is now the backbone of our global client screening.

STAR Story — Automating Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

Q: Tell me about a time you automated a manual process.

S: Enhanced Due Diligence was triggered whenever a client’s risk profile changed. The process relied on Excel trackers, shared mailboxes, and an RPA bot that ran only twice a day. It was error-prone, delayed, and lacked auditability.
T: I was tasked with streamlining and automating this workflow to improve efficiency and audit readiness.
A: I replaced the bot-driven setup with a Kafka-based event-driven architecture. I built a Spring Boot REST API that processed EDD triggers in real time, added role-based access control, audit trails, and integrated with our internal case management system. For observability, I implemented Grafana and Prometheus dashboards.
R: Manual steps were reduced by 75%, average case turnaround time improved by over 30%, and compliance SLA adherence improved dramatically. The process became far more transparent and reliable.

STAR Story — Taking Ownership and Mentorship

Q: Can you give an example of taking ownership beyond your formal role?

S: While leading the batch screening re-architecture, we onboarded a new developer who was unfamiliar with Kafka and streaming design. At the same time, stakeholders were anxious about the technical risks of moving off the legacy platform.
T: I needed to ensure smooth delivery while mentoring the new teammate and securing stakeholder buy-in.
A: I walked the new developer through Kafka streaming patterns and performance trade-offs, reviewed their code, and coached them on best practices. For stakeholders, I presented a proof of concept demonstrating throughput gains and outlined a phased rollout plan to reduce risk.
R: The teammate ramped up quickly and became a key contributor, while stakeholders approved the new design. The re-architecture was delivered successfully and is now the standard for global screening.

This way, your introduction → becomes the foundation for multiple STAR answers.
You can start with a light intro, then naturally segue into one of these STARs when the hiring manager asks for examples.

Do you want me to also build you a STAR out of your Wealth Management Data Quality Platform project? That could serve as a 4th strong story, showing variety outside financial crimes.

S: In Morgan Stanley’s Wealth Management Technology division, our home loans group needed accurate, timely data for CCAR stress loss testing. The existing data pipeline often produced incomplete or inconsistent mortgage data, which created risk for regulatory reporting.
T: I was tasked with designing a solution that would ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of mortgage data used in credit and market risk models.
A: I designed and developed a Data Quality Platform (DQP) using event-driven microservices. The platform reconciled and validated data in real time, automated data quality checks, and logged discrepancies for review. I also built monitoring solutions to track data integrity and ensure transparency for risk and compliance teams.
R: The DQP significantly improved data quality, reduced manual reconciliation effort, and ensured mortgage data was reliable for CCAR stress testing. It also increased stakeholder confidence in the home loans risk models and passed regulatory audits without findings.

So now your STAR portfolio includes:

Batch screening re-architecture (Performance & Scalability)

Automating Enhanced Due Diligence (Process Automation)

Taking Ownership & Mentorship (Leadership/Collaboration)

Data Quality Platform in Wealth Management (Breadth & Impact)

This gives you 4 strong technical STARs + the HR STARs we already built.

Do you want me to also prepare a cheat sheet version (just Situation + Result in one or two lines) for each STAR so you can recall them under pressure?







******************************************************SPRING BATCH**************************************************

What “job logic is first-class” means in Spring Batch
In Autosys:
Autosys itself doesn’t know what the job does.
It just says “Run this shell script at 2 AM.”
The logic lives outside Autosys (in your script or Java program).
Autosys only controls when the script runs and tracks whether it ended successfully.

In Spring Batch:
The logic lives inside the batch framework itself.
You define how to read data, how to process it, how to write output — directly as part of the job.

Spring Batch provides built-in features:
Chunking (e.g., process 1000 records at a time)
Retry/skip rules
Checkpoints for restarts
Job metadata (start/end time, which records failed, etc.)
You don’t just schedule a script — you describe the entire workflow and let Spring Batch manage it.

Analogy
Autosys = a school bell that rings at 9 AM → tells teachers when to start class, but doesn’t teach.
 Spring Batch = the teacher → not only knows when class starts but also teaches, grades, and tracks progress.

Interview Soundbite
"When I say Spring Batch treats job logic as first-class, I mean the framework itself manages not just scheduling but the actual batch workflow — how data is read, processed, and written. Unlike Autosys, which only runs external scripts, Spring Batch gives you built-in chunking, retries, checkpoints, and metadata tracking. This makes it much more powerful for high-volume data processing."

What Spring Batch Is
A framework for batch processing in Java
Designed for large-scale, transactional, repeatable jobs

Handles:
Reading data in bulk
Processing in chunks
Writing results
Managing retries, skips, checkpoints, and job metadata

Think of Spring Batch as Autosys + ETL logic in Java, not just a scheduler.
Autosys → schedules jobs.
Spring Batch → defines and runs the job itself.
(You can still schedule Spring Batch jobs via Autosys, Quartz, or Kubernetes CronJobs.)

Core Concepts (Autosys → Spring Batch mapping)
Job in JIL file->Job in Spring Batch (JobBuilderFactory)
Box/Step in job->	Step (StepBuilderFactory)
Command/script to run ->	Reader → Processor → Writer pattern
Success/failure	-> ExitStatus / JobExecutionListener
Reruns	->Restartable jobs with checkpoints
Logs	->Stored in DB (JobRepository)



3) Typical job flow
[JobLauncher] --> [Job] --> [Step(s)] --> [Reader] --> [Processor] --> [Writer]

JobLauncher: Starts the job
Job: A batch process, made of steps
Step: A stage in the job
Reader: Reads input (DB, file, Kafka, etc.)
Processor: Applies business logic
Writer: Writes output (DB, MQ, file, API)




@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing   // Enables Spring Batch features like JobRepository, JobLauncher, etc.
public class BatchConfig {

    @Autowired
    private JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory; // Factory to create Jobs
    @Autowired
    private StepBuilderFactory stepBuilderFactory; // Factory to create Steps

    // Define the Job: "screeningJob"
    @Bean
    public Job screeningJob() {
        return jobBuilderFactory.get("screeningJob")
            .start(screeningStep())  // Job starts with a single Step
            .build();
    }

    // Define the Step: "screeningStep"
    @Bean
    public Step screeningStep() {
        return stepBuilderFactory.get("screeningStep")
            // Define chunk size = 1000 records at a time
            // Meaning: Read up to 1000 Clients → Process → Write → Commit checkpoint
            .<Client, Alert>chunk(1000)
            
            // ItemReader: Reads input data from DB (CLIENTS table)
            .reader(clientReader())

            // ItemProcessor: Applies business logic on each Client record
            // Example: Check for sanctions, PEP, or adverse media
            .processor(screeningProcessor())

            // ItemWriter: Writes processed Alerts (here printing, in real world → DB/MQ/Actimize)
            .writer(alertWriter())

            // Fault tolerance config: handle retries/skips gracefully
            .faultTolerant()
            .retryLimit(3) // Retry up to 3 times if a recoverable error occurs
            .retry(SQLException.class) // Example: retry DB-related errors
            .skipLimit(10) // Skip up to 10 bad records without failing the job
            .skip(BadRecordException.class) // Skip if a record is malformed
            .build();
    }

    // Reader: Pulls client data from the CLIENTS table using JDBC cursor
    // Cursor allows efficient reading of large result sets without loading all into memory
    @Bean
    public ItemReader<Client> clientReader() {
        return new JdbcCursorItemReaderBuilder<Client>()
            .dataSource(dataSource)
            .sql("SELECT * FROM CLIENTS") // Query to fetch clients
            .rowMapper(new ClientRowMapper()) // Maps each row to a Client object
            .build();
    }

    // Processor: Takes each Client and creates an Alert after applying risk checks
    @Bean
    public ItemProcessor<Client, Alert> screeningProcessor() {
        return client -> new Alert(client.getId(), checkRisk(client));
    }

    // Writer: Handles the processed batch (Alerts)
    // For now, just prints results. In production, could write to DB2, MQ, or call an API.
    @Bean
    public ItemWriter<Alert> alertWriter() {
        return alerts -> alerts.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}

1)Reader queries the CLIENTS table.
2)Loads records lazily (thanks to JdbcCursorItemReader).
3)Processor applies risk screening logic per record.
Example: Runs sanctions or PEP checks.

4)Writer outputs processed alerts.
5)Could store them in DB, send to MQ, or create case files.
6)Chunk(1000) ensures that for every 1000 records processed:
7)A commit/checkpoint is made.
8)If the job fails, restart picks up from the last checkpoint.
9)Retry/Skip ensures the job continues smoothly even with transient DB errors or some bad records.

DB: CLIENTS Table → Read 1000 records

   Processor → Apply checks
        ↓
   Writer → Save alerts

Crash at record 20,001 ❌

What If You Don’t Configure JobRepository?

Spring Batch defaults to an in-memory Map-based JobRepository.BUT: That means once the JVM shuts down, progress is lost.
For real-world jobs (like your 50M screening system), you always configure a database-backed JobRepository so checkpoints survive crashes or restarts.This creates metadata tables like BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION and BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION .After every chunk commit, it records metadata like how many records have been read and written.Spring Batch writes checkpoint info there.If the job fails, a restart looks up the last committed checkpoint from the DB and resumes from there instead of starting over. This makes it efficient for large jobs like our 50M-record screening, where restarts need to be incremental rather than from scratch."

Job = screeningJob

Step = screeningStep

Chunk size = 1000

Total records = 50,000

Job fails after processing 20,000 records

1. BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE
One row per logical job run (per job name + parameters).

JOB_INSTANCE_ID	JOB_NAME	JOB_KEY
1	screeningJob	{date=2025-08-03}

2. BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION
One row per actual execution attempt of the job. (Multole rows for multiple execution of same job)

JOB_EXECUTION_ID	JOB_INSTANCE_ID	STATUS	START_TIME	END_TIME	EXIT_CODE	EXIT_MESSAGE
101	1	FAILED	2025-08-03 02:00	2025-08-03 02:30	FAILED	DB Timeout Error

3. BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION
One row per step execution in the job. Tracks counts and last status.

STEP_EXECUTION_ID	JOB_EXECUTION_ID	STEP_NAME	READ_COUNT	WRITE_COUNT	COMMIT_COUNT	SKIP_COUNT	STATUS	START_TIME			END_TIME
201						101				screeningStep	20000		20000		20				5		FAILED	2025-08-03 02:00	2025-08-03 02:30

READ_COUNT = 20000

WRITE_COUNT = 20000

COMMIT_COUNT = 20 (because 20 chunks of 1000 each were committed)

SKIP_COUNT = 5 (skipped 5 bad records)

STATUS = FAILED

4. BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT
Job-level context (serialized as a map).

JOB_EXECUTION_ID	SERIALIZED_CONTEXT
101	{"runDate":"2025-08-03","initiatedBy":"Saurabh"}

5. BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT
Step-level context (checkpoint info for restart).

STEP_EXECUTION_ID	SERIALIZED_CONTEXT
201	{"lastProcessedRecordId":20000,"currentChunk":20}

This tells Spring Batch: last committed chunk = 20

Resume from record 20001 on restart

Flow When Restart Happens
New JobExecution row created in BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION (say, ID = 102).

Step restarts from last checkpoint: 20001.
It continues processing the remaining 30,000 records.


DB Tables:
BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE        → 1 row (screeningJob, params)
BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION       → status=FAILED, read=20000
BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION      → step=screeningStep, commitCount=20
BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CTX  → lastProcessedRecordId=20000

Restart →
Skip first 20000 records → Resume from 20001
Interview Soundbite
"When a job fails, Spring Batch records metadata in tables like BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION and BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT. For example, if we processed 20 chunks of 1000 records each before a crash, the step execution context would save lastProcessedRecordId=20000. On restart, Spring Batch looks this up and resumes from record 20001, instead of reprocessing all 50 million records. This incremental recovery is why it’s so powerful for large-scale screening jobs."   


How Skip Limit Affects Execution
Spring Batch processes records in chunks.

Every time a record throws the exception you marked as skippable, the skip counter increases.

If skip count > skipLimit at any point during the job → the step immediately fails, and the job execution stops — even if there are many records left unprocessed.If needed, we can attach a custom SkipListener that logs each skipped record into a compliance audit table. For example, if a client record is missing a DOB or has an invalid country code, it’s skipped with the reason recorded. This ensures full auditability — our BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION table shows 3 skips, and the BATCH_SKIP_AUDIT table tells us exactly which clients and why. This transparency is critical in AML, since regulators require proof that no client was silently dropped."

************************************************************
*** KAFKA NOTES ***
************************************************************

============================================================
1. BATCH PROCESSING
============================================================
- MapReduce was batch processing?
- Batch processing --> you accumulate data over a day or a fixed interval
  and process it.
    + Processing time + get the output after a certain time.
    + Data is bounded.
- Example:
    -> Credit card usage .. rolling last 30 days report
- The input and output are files.
- Parse the file --> set of records 
    (immutable object that contains the details of something that happened 
     at some point of time).

Reliability:
------------
- A nice property of the batch processing systems we explored in Chapter 10 
  is that they provide a strong reliability guarantee:
    * Failed tasks are automatically retried.
    * Partial output from failed tasks is automatically discarded.
    * Output is the same as if no failures had occurred 
      (simplifies the programming model).
- Later in this chapter we will examine how we can provide similar guarantees
  in a streaming context.

============================================================
2. STREAM PROCESSING
============================================================
- Stream processing ..process every second or rather remove fixed time 
  intervals. Process every event as it comes.
- In general, a “stream” refers to data incrementally made available over time.
- Called an event --> same immutable object as in record 
  with a timestamp.

Encoding:
---------
- An event may be encoded as:
    * text string
    * JSON
    * binary form
- This encoding allows you to:
    * Store an event by appending to a file,
      inserting into relational table,
      or writing to a document database.
    * Send the event over the network to another node for processing.

Analogy with Batch:
-------------------
- Batch: A file is written once and read by multiple jobs.
- Stream: An event is generated once by a producer (publisher/sender), 
  then processed by multiple consumers (subscribers/recipients).

============================================================
3. POLLING VS NOTIFICATIONS
============================================================
- Producer writes events to datastore.
- Consumer periodically polls datastore for new events.

Problems with Polling:
----------------------
- For continual processing with low delays, polling becomes expensive.
- Frequent polling = higher overhead, fewer new events found.

Notifications:
--------------
- Better if consumers are notified when new events appear.
- Traditional databases do not support good notification mechanisms.
- RDBMS triggers exist but are limited and an afterthought.

Industry Example:
-----------------
- UDP multicast widely used in the financial industry 
  (e.g., stock market feeds).
- UDP itself unreliable, but application-level protocols recover lost packets.
- Producers/consumers must remain online.

============================================================
4. MESSAGE BROKERS
============================================================
Definition:
-----------
- Alternative: Use a Message Broker (Message Queue).
- Optimized database for handling message streams.
- Runs as a server; producers and consumers connect as clients.

Durability:
-----------
- Some keep messages in memory only.
- Others write to disk (to survive broker crash).

Consumer Handling:
------------------
- Can tolerate clients connecting/disconnecting/crashing.
- Slow consumers handled with unbounded queueing.
- Producer usually waits only for broker acknowledgment, 
  not consumer processing.

Limitations:
------------
- Brokers usually delete a message once successfully delivered.
- Not for long-term data storage.
- Large queues = slower processing, lower throughput.

Data Access:
------------
- Databases: Tables/Secondary indexes and search queries.
- Message Brokers: Topic subscriptions / pattern matching.
- Both allow clients to select relevant data.

============================================================
5. MESSAGING PATTERNS in STREAMING SYSTEMS
============================================================

a) Load Balancing
-----------------
- Each message delivered to one consumer.
- Useful when processing is expensive.
- Add more consumers for parallelism.
- Broker may assign messages arbitrarily.

b) Fan-Out
----------
- Each message delivered to all consumers.
- Several independent consumers can "tune in" to same broadcast.
- Equivalent of multiple batch jobs reading the same input file.
- Supported by: 
    * Topic subscriptions (JMS)
    * Exchange bindings (AMQP)

c) Combined Pattern
-------------------
- Two or more groups subscribe.
- Each group collectively receives all messages.
- Within group, each message handled by one consumer.

============================================================
6. LOW LATENCY & RELIABILITY
============================================================

Acknowledgments:
----------------
- Consumers may crash anytime.
- To prevent message loss:
    * Broker requires explicit acknowledgment after processing.
    * If no ack, broker redelivers to another consumer.

Message Reordering:
-------------------
- Redelivery + load balancing may cause reordering.
- Avoid by using separate queue per consumer.
- Reordering fine for independent messages.
- Problematic if causal dependencies exist.

============================================================
7. LOG-BASED MESSAGE BROKERS
============================================================

Concept:
--------
- Hybrid of database durability + message broker low-latency.
- Log = Append-only sequence of records on disk.

Operation:
----------
- Producer appends to log.
- Consumer reads sequentially.
- If at log end, waits for new message notification.
- Similar to Unix `tail -f`.

Partitioning for Scale:
-----------------------
- Logs can be partitioned across machines for high throughput.
- Topic = group of partitions of same message type.
- Within each partition:
    * Messages get monotonically increasing offset.
    * Messages in partition are totally ordered.
    * No ordering guarantee across partitions.

Performance & Fault Tolerance:
------------------------------
- Can reach millions of messages/sec.
- Achieved through:
    * Partitioning
    * Replication
	
	
============================================================
8. DO ALL PARTITIONS CARRY THE SAME MESSAGES?
============================================================

Answer:
-------
No, partitions do not carry the same messages. 
Messages are distributed across partitions based on a partitioning strategy,
which determines where a message is sent.

Partitioning Strategies:
------------------------

1) Key-Based Partitioning (Default Strategy)
   - If a message has a key, Kafka uses a hashing algorithm 
     to determine the partition for that message.
   - Ensures all messages with the same key go to the same partition.
   - Maintains order for messages with the same key.
   - Example customerId, accountId as the key

2) Round-Robin Partitioning
   - If no key is provided, Kafka assigns messages to partitions 
     in a round-robin fashion.
   - Balances the load evenly across partitions.

3) Custom Partitioning
   - Users can implement their own partitioning logic 
     to decide which partition a message should go to.

Key Considerations:
-------------------

- Order Preservation:
  * Order is guaranteed only within a single partition, not across partitions.
  * Example:
      Partition 0 --> "A, B, C"
      Partition 1 --> "D, E, F"
    Combined order of A–F is not guaranteed.

- Load Balancing:
  * Proper partitioning ensures no partition is overloaded.
  * Misconfigurations (e.g., skewed key distributions) 
    can cause uneven loads.

- Consumer Assignment:
  * Each partition is read by only one consumer 
    within a consumer group.
  * Facilitates parallelism but ensures no duplication of processing.
  * Consumer groups to support fan out..
  
  ============================================================
BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE PARALLELISM IN KAFKA
============================================================

Rule of Thumb:
--------------
- Maximum parallelism in Kafka = Number of partitions in a topic.
- To fully utilize parallelism:
    -> Number of consumers in a consumer group 
       should equal the number of partitions.

Why?
----
- Each partition can be consumed by only ONE consumer 
  in the same consumer group at a time.
- If you have more consumers than partitions:
    * Extra consumers will sit idle.
- If you have fewer consumers than partitions:
    * Some consumers will handle multiple partitions.
    * Parallelism is limited.

Scenarios:
----------

1) Equal Consumers = Partitions
   - Optimal parallelism.
   - Each consumer gets exactly one partition.
   - Ensures balanced load (assuming even partition sizes).

2) Consumers < Partitions
   - Some consumers handle multiple partitions.
   - Still works but may limit throughput.
   - Useful if you want fewer long-running consumers.

3) Consumers > Partitions
   - Extra consumers will remain idle.
   - No additional gain in throughput.

Other Considerations:
---------------------

- Load Balancing:
  * Even if #consumers == #partitions, skewed key distribution
    can overload some partitions.
  * Mitigation: Review partitioning strategy and key distribution.

- Scaling Up:
  * If you need more throughput later, you must increase
    the number of partitions (topic-level change).
	- Increasing partitions usually breaks ordering only when 
  partitioning logic depends on partition_count (like hashing).
	- Many teams pre-allocate more partitions than currently needed (say 2–3x the expected consumers), then use stable partitioning rules so they don’t need to change partition counts later.
	
- Consumer Group Isolation:
  * Parallelism is per consumer group.
  * If two different consumer groups subscribe to the same topic,
    each group gets its own full set of messages.

============================================================
CONCLUSION
============================================================
- Best practice: Match the number of consumers in a consumer group 
  to the number of partitions in the topic.
- This gives maximum parallelism and balanced workload distribution.

	
Typical Scenarios Where Ordering Is Needed:
-------------------------------------------

1) Financial Transactions
   - Example: Bank account credits and debits.
   - Processing in wrong order may cause incorrect balances.
   - Key choice: account_id → all transactions for an account 
     go to one partition.

2) Inventory Management
   - Example: E-commerce stock updates (Add, Reserve, Cancel).
   - Out-of-order updates may lead to overselling.
   - Key choice: product_id.

3) User Activity Streams
   - Example: Timeline of actions for a specific user (post, like, comment).
   - Wrong order would make the timeline inconsistent.
   - Key choice: user_id
6) IoT Sensor Data per Device
   - Example: Temperature sensor sending readings every second.
   - For a given device, order matters (to detect anomalies, trends).
   - Key choice: device_id.

Scenarios Where Ordering Is NOT Needed:
---------------------------------------
- Aggregated metrics (e.g., daily counts, averages).
- Independent events that don’t affect each other.
- Large-scale log collection for analytics.
- Search indexing (documents can be indexed in any order).

- Require ordering when:
    * Correctness depends on event sequence for an entity.
    * Use case involves balances, state transitions, or logs replay.
- For analytics, monitoring, or independent events, ordering 
  is not necessary (and avoiding it improves throughput).   

What If You Require Ordering Across ALL Partitions?
---------------------------------------------------
- To maintain a global sequence, Kafka would need to:
   1) Force all messages into a single partition
      OR
   2) Coordinate ordering across multiple partitions before delivery.  
   

- To enforce global order, producers must:
   1) Agree on a global sequence number before sending.
   2) Possibly buffer messages until correct order is determined.
   
Partition 0: [ T1, T4, T7 ]
Partition 1: [ T2, T3, T6 ]
Partition 2: [ T5, T8 ]

Required Global Order: [ T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8 ]
Consumer Task: Merge the streams from all partitions 
               into one unified ordered stream.

Step 2: Buffering
-----------------
- Some partitions may lag behind others.
- To maintain strict order, consumer must WAIT until the "next in sequence"
  from a slower partition arrives.

Example:
--------
Partition 0 delivers T1, T4 quickly.
Partition 1 is slow → T2 arrives late.

Consumer has T1 ready.
But cannot emit T4 yet, because T2 must come before it.
So it buffers T4 until T2 arrives.

Consequences:
-------------
- Higher Latency:
   * Messages must wait in buffer until the correct order can be ensured.

- Memory Overhead:
   * Out-of-order messages are stored temporarily.
   * More partitions → more buffering.

- Reduced Throughput:
   * Consumers idle while waiting for missing events.

============================================================
CONCLUSION
============================================================
- Global ordering requires merging per-partition streams 
  into a single timeline.
- Because partitions produce asynchronously, consumers must buffer 
  messages until the correct sequence is available.
- This merging & buffering kills the natural parallelism of Kafka.
- That’s why Kafka encourages partition-level ordering only 
  (with a key like account_id or product_id).

Loses Kafka’s key advantage: horizontal scaling.
- This coordination breaks Kafka’s design goal of scalable,
  partition-parallel throughput.
- Best Practice: Use partition-level ordering with a suitable key
  (e.g., account_id, product_id) to avoid global ordering overhead   


1. What is Apache Kafka?
Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps.
In my project, we used Kafka to distribute 50M client screening records across multiple worker services for parallel processing.

2. What is a Topic?
A topic is a category or feed name where records are published.
Example: screening.jobs topic held batches of client records to be screened.

3. What are Partitions in Kafka? Why are they important?
A topic is split into partitions for parallelism.
Records inside each partition are ordered.
They allow multiple consumers to process data in parallel.
In my case, 50M records were partitioned by Client ID/Region across 10 partitions.

4. What is a Consumer Group?
A group of consumers that share work on a topic.A consumer group consumes 1 topic as a whole
Each partition is consumed by only one consumer in the group (to avoid duplicate processing)
This allows horizontal scaling.
We deployed 10 workers in the same consumer group so each got a unique partition of client data. 

5. What is an Offset?
The position of a consumer (or rather a consumer group) in a partition (like a bookmark).
Consumers commit offsets so they know where to resume after failure.
Kafka stores offsets in a special topic called __consumer_offsets.
This allowed us to resume screening at record #20,001 after a failure, without duplicating earlier work.
They’re tracked at the level of consumer group + partition.

1. Not Per Consumer
Kafka doesn’t store offsets per individual consumer instance.
Why? Because consumers in the same group are interchangeable (load balanced).
2. Not Just Per Partition
If you had only partition offsets, multiple consumer groups could conflict.
Each group may consume the same topic independently.
3. Per Consumer Group + Partition ✅
That’s the correct level.
Each consumer group has its own offsets for each partition it consumes.
Two groups can read the same topic but maintain different progress.

5. How does Kafka ensure ordering?
Ordering is guaranteed within a partition, not across the whole topic.
By using a partition key (like Client ID), we ensured that all records for the same client stayed in order.

7. How does Kafka provide Fault Tolerance?
Topics are replicated across brokers.
If one broker fails, another replica serves the data.
If a consumer fails, Kafka rebalances partitions to another consumer.

Kafka is a distributed event bus that gives us parallelism, ordering, and replayability. In my last project, we partitioned a 50M record screening job by Client ID and Region into 10 Kafka partitions. Multiple worker microservices consumed the partitions in parallel, each resuming from the last committed offset if a failure occurred. This design reduced processing time by 40%, gave us fault tolerance, and allowed compliance to replay jobs when sanction lists updated."


📌 Acks in Kafka
1. Producer → Broker (Write Acknowledgment)
When your screening worker (producer) sends an alert to Kafka, it waits for an ack from the broker.
This is controlled by the acks config in the producer.
acks=0 → Producer doesn’t wait. (Fastest, least reliable)
With acks=0, you lose durability — if a message is dropped, the producer never retries because it thinks it was delivered.
acks=1 → Leader broker writes message, ack sent back. (Common)
acks=all (or -1) → Leader + all in-sync replicas confirm write before ack. (Most reliable; used in compliance systems)

                     ↑
2. Broker → Consumer (Read Acknowledgment)
Consumers don’t send acks like producers.
Instead, consumers commit offsets to Kafka to signal progress.
When a consumer processes messages from a partition, it calls:
1) auto-commit (default) → Kafka commits offsets automatically every X ms.
   
auto.commit.interval.ms (default 5 seconds). Risk: if your worker crashes after processing but before auto-commit, you may reprocess the same message (duplicate alerts).

2) manual commit → app explicitly commits offsets after successful processing.

In Spring Kafka, you can disable auto-commit and handle commits yourself.
This ensures a record is marked as processed only after you’ve successfully handled it (e.g., stored alert in Actimize).

👉 Why important?

If consumer crashes before committing, on restart it re-reads those messages.
That’s why in AML screening, you’d use manual commit after writing alerts to DB, so no message is lost.

@KafkaListener(topics = "screening.jobs", groupId = "screening-workers")
public void consume(ClientRecord record, Acknowledgment ack) {
    try {
        // 1. Process the screening
        Alert alert = screeningService.runScreening(record);
        alertRepository.save(alert);

        // 2. Commit offset manually only after success
        ack.acknowledge();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // No ack → offset not committed
        // Kafka will retry this message
        log.error("Error processing record: {}", record, e);
    }
}
3. How It Ties to Acks
Producer side → uses acks=all for broker acknowledgment.
Consumer side → uses Acknowledgment.acknowledge() for offset commit.

👉 Together, they ensure:
Message is safely written (producer ack).
Message is safely processed (consumer ack).

With acks=1, the producer may send P2 before retrying P1 if the ACK for P1 is delayed or lost. That can break ordering within a partition if retries are enabled(retries + multiple in flight messages)
To solve this, we enable idempotence, which adds sequence numbers so Kafka can detect and discard out-of-order retries.


4)Idempotence (enable.idempotence=true)
Independent of acks. Different concept

Adds:
Producer ID (PID)
Sequence numbers per partition
Guarantees no duplicates and preserves ordering, even if retries happen.
Works with any acks, but for compliance workloads you’d pair it with acks=all.

Idempotence protects ordering and duplicates. But latency may increase 
Producer → Send 57 → Leader fails → No ACK
Producer → Send 58 → Broker expects 57 → REJECT ❌
Producer → Retry 57 → Broker commits → [Log: 57]
Producer → Retry 58 → Broker commits → [Log: 57,58]

If acks=0 and idempotency is true then it can lead to dataloss + log stuck

acks=0 + idempotence=true
Producer → Seq=57 → LOST ❌
Producer → Seq=58 → Broker expects 57 → REJECT ❌
Broker Log: stuck at last committed=56
Producer thinks 57 succeeded (no ack)
Ordering preserved ✅

But data loss ❌
Producer doesn’t retry 57 → log stuck

If we remove idempotence, it wont stall the partition .. But there will be duplicates and silent data loss

What Happens Without Idempotence (and acks=0) ?
Producer sends P1 (lost) → Kafka never gets it.
Producer sends P2, P3, ... → Kafka accepts them blindly because it’s not expecting any specific sequence.

📌 There is no stalling.
📌 But there’s silent data loss.
