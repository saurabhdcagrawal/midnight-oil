what is advantage of spring batch..what does it do

Spring Batch is a powerful framework designed for batch processing in Java,
part of the larger Spring ecosystem. It's widely used for automating large-scale,
repetitive, and transactional processing like ETL jobs, data migrations, or scheduled reports.

Robust and Scalable
Handles large volumes of data efficiently (millions of records).
Supports parallel processing, chunking, partitioning, and multi-threaded steps.

Transaction Management
Provides declarative transaction control, retry logic, and rollback in case of failures.

Built-in Features
Skip/Retry logic, checkpoints, job restarts, and listeners.

Easily handle failures without restarting from the beginning.
Modular and Reusable
Jobs are broken down into steps, which can be reused and independently tested.
Maintains detailed metadata for job executions, step status, and failures in its job repository.
What Does Spring Batch Do?
It provides a framework to define and run batch jobs consisting of:
Job: The overall batch process (e.g., "import users from CSV").
Step: A phase within the job (e.g., "read", "process", "write").
ItemReader: Reads data (e.g., from DB, CSV, API).
ItemProcessor: Applies business logic (e.g., clean, filter, transform).
ItemWriter: Writes data (e.g., into DB, file, Kafka).
JobRepository: Persists execution metadata for restartability and monitoring.


Feature	Spring Batch
AutoSys
What it is	A Java-based batch processing framework
A job scheduler
Focus
Defines how the job runs (logic, reading, processing, writing)
Defines when and where the job runs
Core Function	Executes ETL/data processing logic inside the app
Triggers external scripts or jobs (e.g., shell, SQL, Java)
Data Handling	Native support for chunking, retry, skip, checkpointing
Not built for deep data transformation
Job Design	You define step-by-step logic in Java/Spring
You define commands or scripts to run
Error Handling	Granular: retry specific items, skip logic, restart where it failed
Mostly job-level: restart the whole job or rerun a script
Metadata Tracking	Built-in job repository: tracks job status, step execution, etc.	Tracks at job level (success/fail), less detailed execution state
Integration	Part of your application, tightly integrated with Spring Boot	External to your app, platform-level scheduler

ou need to build the logic of a job (e.g., reading from CSV → transforming → writing to DB).

You want fine-grained control over data flow, retries, skip policies.

You’re working in a Spring-based microservices architecture.

You need job restartability, detailed job metadata, or multi-threaded processing.

✅ When to Use AutoSys:
You already have your job logic in scripts or compiled apps and just need scheduling/orchestration.

You want to trigger jobs on time-based or event-based schedules.

You need cross-platform job control (Linux, Windows, SAP, etc.).

Your org already uses AutoSys to manage enterprise workloads.

⚡ Best of Both Worlds?
Many teams combine them:

Use Spring Batch for the actual data processing logic.
Use AutoSys to schedule and orchestrate Spring Batch jobs
 (via shell scripts or command-line triggers).
✅ Why This Works Well
Spring Batch takes care of data transformation, checkpointing, error handling.

AutoSys ensures enterprise-grade scheduling, dependencies, retry policies, etc.

Teams stay aligned with DevOps best practices: separate business logic (app) from orchestration
(AutoSys).


With Spring boot you can create robust batch processing system
Batch processing is a technique which processes data in a large group
instead of single element of data

Spring batch
First key component--> Job launcher-->launch to a spring batch job->initiate job
job launcher call run method-->launch a job->Job repository

Every time a record comes in
Job--> Can chain multiple steps ->
Step==> Item Reader(reads from source..one record at a time
), ItemProcessor(transformation),
ItemWriter(write to database)

//job repository-->How many files we have done, how many files we need to process
//after records are written transaction, commits,write metadata to file
SpringBatch


New Class TextItemProcessor implements ItemProcessor<String,String>
@Override
public String process(String message) throws Exception{
    return processedMessage
}

@Bean
protected FlatFileItemReader<String> reader(){
//source
}

@Bean
protected FlatFileItemWriter<String> writer(){
//output csv
}

@Bean
protected Step maskingStep(JobRepository jobRepo, PlatformTransactionManager manager,
FlatFileItemReader<String> reader,TextItemProcessor processor, FlatFileItemWriter<String> writer){
return newStepBuilder
}
//chunk out processing..


//Spring batch will look for the job
@Bean
protected Job maskingJob(JobRepository jobRepo, Step maskingStep, BatchJobCompletedListener jobCompleted)   {

}



//New class
@Component
public class BatchJobCompletedListener implements JobExecutionListener{
@Override
public void afterJob(JobExecution jobExecution)

}
