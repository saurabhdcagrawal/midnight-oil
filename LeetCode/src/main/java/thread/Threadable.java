THREAD
        To define deadlock, first I would define process.
        Process : As we know process is nothing but a program in execution.

        Resource : To execute a program process needs some resources.
        Resource categories may include memory, printers, CPUs, open files, tape drives, CD-ROMS, etc.

        Deadlock : Deadlock is a situation or condition when two or more processes are
        holding some resources and trying to acquire some more resources,
        and they can not release the resources until they finish there execution.

        Deadlock condition or situation

        n the above diagram there are two process P1 and p2 and there are two resources R1 and R2.

        Resource R1 is allocated to process P1 and resource R2 is allocated to process p2.
        To complete execution of process P1 needs resource R2,
        so P1 request for R2, but R2 is already allocated to P2.

        In the same way Process P2 to complete its execution needs R1,
        but R1 is already allocated to P1.

        both the processes can not release their resource until
        and unless they complete their execution.

        So both are waiting for another resources and they will wait forever.
        So this is a DEADLOCK Condition.

        In order for deadlock to occur, four conditions must be true.

        Mutual exclusion - Each resource is either currently allocated to exactly
        one process or it is available.
        (Two processes cannot simultaneously control the same resource or be in their critical section).
        Hold and Wait - processes currently holding resources can request new resources.
        No preemption - Once a process holds a resource, it cannot be taken away by another process
        or the kernel.
        Circular wait - Each process is waiting to obtain a resource which is held by another process

        Ways to avoid having deadlocks are:

        avoid having locks (if possible),
        avoid having more than one lock
        always take the locks in the same order.
