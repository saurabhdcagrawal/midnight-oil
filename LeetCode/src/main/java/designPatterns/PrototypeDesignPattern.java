//Creational design pattern related to class and object creation

// object in the best possible way for specific situations.
//object creation is a costly affair and requires lot of time and resources
//and you have a similar object existing
//mechanism to copy original object to new object and modify it according to our needs
/*
Sometimes, object creation is heavyweight and requires a lot of resources,
        creating a new instance will impact the performance. In such cases,
        a prototype design pattern is used which refers to creating duplicate objects.
        In prototype design pattern,
        if a similar object is already present then cloning is done keeping performance in mind.
