Statistical learning & Business analytics
	Helps in Analyzing data
	Descriptive statistics
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6wG_sAdP0U&ab_channel=TED
	
	Classification
		Classes of unit in the data
		Ways to segment/say how many kinds of customers do I have
		Classifying different kinds of customers in different kinds of bucket
	
	Pattern Recognition
		Recognizing data forms that appear to be common
		Look at distribution of data to see what kind of data is rare/common
		Histogram, Scatter, box plot,bar plot ->Techniques to visually analyze the data
	
	Association
		Relationship between objects
		there is a 40% chance that if you buy coffee you buy bread
		Think in terms of what data might be or might been
		How does uncertainty relate to data
		How do I put uncertainty into the analysis of data on a computer
		
	Predictive Analytics
		Models
			Regression
			Logistic Regression
			Neural Networks
	
	Business Analytics		
		Analytics synonymous to quantitative
		Broad use of data and quantitative analysis(quantitative methods) for decision making within the organization
		qualitative vs quantitative
		hot outside vs 90 degree F outside
		quant means precise(Gives you a sense of why we are doing what we are doing)
		Why this is a good choice? Because quantitavely I can convince you that it gives a higher profit
		qualititaive= what we been doing= mental model	
		Qualitative(Intuitive,human way)
		real world->observation->mental model (how I believe the world works like)->make decisions
		Quantitative way(improve model)
		real world->data(precise observation)->mathematical model(how I believe the world works like said in precise steps)->make decisions

		Everytime someone says a mathematical model, its just a precise statement of how they believe their segment of world looks like
		AI is application.. when data to decision process is used to create a product which behaves human like..self autonomous car or playing chess, then its called AIs
		Making the computer do something smart.. we made it do, its not natural.. thats why artificial	
		AI is broad term.. 
		ML is a subset of AI..it is at the core of ML.....machine is able to learn from the data once told how to do so..uses some basic statistical models
		Deep learning is a subset of ML (machine is setup a way where machine works in a way human brains, neural networks, series of layers ?) 
		Data science--> Human involvement is there on the part of decision making.. 
		ML is at the intersection  of Computer Science, Math & Statistics
		Software development is at the intersection of Computer Science & Business Domain/Knowledge
		Traditional Research is intersection of Business/Domain Knowledge and Math & Statistics
		Data Science lies at the intersection of Computer Science, Math & Statistics & Business/Domain Knowledge
		There are layers

	Statistical Methodologies
		Descriptive statistics  what is -> data summarization, graphs,charts and talks 
		Inferential statistics  what also might be -> talk about population parameter from sample (take a sample of data and make inferences about the population from it)
		Staistics drives the lines between the two
		
	Statistical jargon
		Population->universe of possible data for a specified object(past,present, future) Eg people who have visited a website of will visit the website (not observed)
		Parameters-> numerical value associated with a population eg no of clicks made on the website (not observed)
		Sample-> Selection of observations from a population (people who actualy visited the website on a given day) (observed)
		Statistic-->numerical value associated with an observed sample..the average amount of time people spent on website on a given day (observed)
		Statistical problem to go from observed to non observed,from the sample to the population because the object we are interested in
		is not the statistic but the parameter because the universe we are interested is the population and not the sample or data we have.
		
	Primary data
		Collected by the organization itself for a particular purpose. Fit the needs exactly, up to date and reliable
	Secondary Data
		Collected by a different organization/s. Published by government/archives/other organizations
	qualitative data -> non numeric eg gender, religion, place of birth
	quantitative data-> numeric	
		Further divided into discrete and continous
	Term document matrix converts qualitative data into quantitative data	
		Different kinds of data was discussed.. spatial, audio, video, pictures, text, numerical, matrices
	
	Measure of central tendency
		Mean-->average of the values... affected by extremes if we change (requires measurement on all observations)
		Median-> middle observation..no effect if we change the extremes( greater resistance to outliers) (does not require measurement on all observations) Q2
		Mode-> maximum frequency of occurence (typical value)(does not require measurement on all observations)	
	Measures of dispersion
		Range= max-min.. affected by extremes (outliers)
		Interquartile range(IQR)= q3-q1.. arrange data set in ascending order and range computed on the middle 50% of the observations..
			Eliminate lower 25% and upper 25%
			Less affected by outliers
			Range of the middle 50% of data
		Variance	
			Average of the squared differences from mean is the variance
		Standard Deviation: How much each data point differs from the mean
			Square root of the variance
			Problem of units...how do we know how big/small the value is
		Coefficient of Variation
			Standard Deviation as the percentage of mean
		Z score
			How do I know if 6 feet is tall, if tall how tall?
			calibrate a measure w.r.t its own distribution
			(observation-mean)/(standard deviation)
			if Z score is 1 then 1standard deviation above the average, if 2 then 2 standard deviation below the average	
	Exploratory data analysis
		Set of tools that analyze the data not for the purpose of building a model or extracting intelligence but just to describe/explore aspects of it
		that may be useful for future model building or future extraction of intelligence
		John Tukey..coined the term in 1960's
		To make data analysis easier
		Qualitative Variables
			Nominal: No numerical value (names) and ordinal variables(very dissatisfied)	
		Quantitative Variables
			Numerical value associated with it
			
	Five number summary
		Minimum, q1(lower quartile), Q2 (median), Q3(75th percentile or upper quartile), maximum
	Skeweness/Shape of data
		Skewness is a measure of the extent to which the data values are not symmetrical around the mean.
		If mean, median and mode agree it points to a perfect symmetrical distribution(bell curve) i.e mean=median then we have zero skewness
		if mean>median ..positive or right skewed distribution..(data leaks to the right)
		if mean<median ..negative or left side distribution (data leaks to the left)
		Hint: median will always be closest to mode
	Box plot
		Around the five number summary with extremes as tails.. box starts from Q1 and ends at Q3..line inside the box at Q2 median
		Size of the box is IQR
		Shape of box adapts to the skewness in the data
		Q3+1.5 times the size of the box..values beyond can be considered as outliers (both sides.. q3+1.5IQR, q1-1.5IQR)
	For 2D
		Covariance--to measure how one variable varies w.r.t variance in another variable(if one variable becomes large does the other also become large or small at the same time)
					This is +ve covariance
					A negative value indicates the 2 variables move in opposite direction to each other
		Correlation
			Determine the strength of the relationship between 2 variables
			Covariance/product of Standard Deviation
			Does not imply causation...?
			Diff between covariance and correlation?
