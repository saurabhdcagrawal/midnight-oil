1. Creational: These patterns are designed for class instantiation. They can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns.

2. Structural: These patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. 
The main goal of most of these patterns is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

3. Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others

Strategy pattern(behavioural)
	Defines a family of algorithms (interchangeable), encapsulates each one and make them interchangeable.
In simpler terms, the Strategy Design Pattern provides a way to extract the behavior of an object into separate classes that can be swapped in and out at runtime. 
        This enables code  to be more flexible and reusable, as different strategies can be easily added or modified without changing 
		the object's core code.

	A shopping cart application may use the Strategy Design Pattern to encapsulate credit card, PayPal, and cryptocurrency payment 
	methods into separate strategies that can be swapped at runtime. The application's payment processing system would delegate
	the payment processing logic to the current payment method's strategy, allowing for easy modification and extension of the
	payment processing logic.


Observer pattern(behaviourial)
			The observer pattern defines a one to many relationship so that when one object changes state , all of its dependent objects
			are notified and updated accordingly
			IObservable==> one to many IObservers
			it has methods add(iobserver), remove(iobserver) and notify, getState
			IObserver==>update.. called by notify of observerable
			When we instantitatite the observer, in the constructor we pass the reference of the concrete implementation of iObservable(Bidirectional) 
			So that the observer knows what changed or what the current state of observable is..(get the new data)

Iterator Design Pattern ( behaviourial)
 provides a way to access the elements of a collection (aggregate object) sequentially without exposing its underlying 
 representation . 	
 The Iterator pattern consists of two main components: an Iterator and an Aggregate. 
 The Iterator defines a uniform interface for accessing the elements of the collection, 
 and the Aggregate provides a method for creating an Iterator that can traverse the collection. 
 The Iterator interface typically includes methods like next, hasNext, remove, and current. 
 The Iterator and Aggregate interfaces work together to provide a seamless and standardized way of iterating over a collection.

	
Singleton pattern (Creational design pattern)
	Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it
	Things should not be leaking in global namespace..important to scope it..
	It can change without you knowing it..
	Make unit testing very difficult..	
	Constructor of the singleton class is private
	Static methods.. to create first instance
	private static Singleton instance
	public static Singleton getInstance(){
		if (instance==null)
			instance = new Singleton();
		return instance;	
	}


Factory Design pattern (Creational design pattern)

The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input,
we need to return one of the sub-class.
This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class


public interface Shape{
    void draw();
}
public Rectangle implements Shape{
    public void draw(){
        System.out.println("Inside Rectangle draw method");
    }
}
public Square implements Shape{
    public void draw(){
      System.out.println("Inside Square draw method");
    }
}
public Circle implements Shape{
    public void draw(){
        System.out.println("Inside Square draw method");
    }
}

public class ShapeFactory{
    public Shape getShape(String shape){
        if(SHAPE.equals("RECTANGLE")
            return new Rectangle();
        else if(SHAPE.equals("Square")
            return new Square();
        else if(SHAPE.equals("CIRCLE")
            return new Circle();
        else
            return null;
    }
}
    Main
    ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
    //get an object of Circle and call its draw method.
       Shape shape1 = shapeFactory.getShape("CIRCLE");
    //call draw method of Circle
          shape1.draw();
	
BuilderDesignPattern(Creational)
It can be used to streamline the creation of complex objects making your code more readable and 
less prone to developer error by removing the need to call a long constructor or call multiple setter methods to create an object.
	
Implement a separate, concrete Builder class to delegating object creation to rather than trying to build directly through a convoluted constructor.	
public class BankAccount {

    public static class Builder {

        private long accountNumber; //This is important, so we'll pass it to the constructor.
        private String owner;
        private String branch;
        private double balance;
        private double interestRate;

        public Builder(long accountNumber) {
            this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
        }

        public Builder withOwner(String owner){
            this.owner = owner;

            return this;  //By returning the builder each time, we can create a fluent interface.
        }

        public Builder atBranch(String branch){
            this.branch = branch;

            return this;
        }

        public Builder openingBalance(double balance){
            this.balance = balance;

            return this;
        }

        public Builder atRate(double interestRate){
            this.interestRate = interestRate;

            return this;
        }

        public BankAccount build(){
            //Here we create the actual bank account object, which is always in a fully initialised state when it's returned.
            BankAccount account = new BankAccount();  //Since the builder is in the BankAccount class, we can invoke its private constructor.
            account.accountNumber = this.accountNumber;
            account.owner = this.owner;
            account.branch = this.branch;
            account.balance = this.balance;
            account.interestRate = this.interestRate;

            return account;
        }
    }

    //Fields omitted for brevity.
    private BankAccount() {
        //Constructor is now private.
    }

    //Getters and setters omitted for brevity.

}
	BankAccount account = new BankAccount.Builder(1234L)
            .withOwner("Marge")
            .atBranch("Springfield")
            .openingBalance(100)
            .atRate(2.5)
            .build();
	
Adapter pattern (Structural)
	Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together
	Client(wall socket) expects a target interface with a target method(request)( 2 plug), however you have a 3 point plug (available interface..or adaptee)
	Adapter has a composition of adaptee and implements the methods of the target// it will expose methods of target and in turn calls the method of adaptee
	All classes must implement every method defined by the shared interface
	Not add additional behaviour
	
	
	Client                  interface Itarget
							request
								/		
								|
								|
								|
							(concrete)Adapter-----------------------Adaptee
															specific_request()
				Itarget target = new Adapter(new Adaptee())
				target.request()
				//Adapter implements Itarget
				
				Adapter has adaptee.
				public void request(){
					adaptee.specific_request()
				}
					
Decorator pattern
			Attached added responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
			Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality
			Adding additional behavior to the object without opening up and changing that object
		
			Abstract class
		 Component                 has a 
				Method A--------------|
				Method B 			  |	
			/ \          \	is a 	  |	
			 |	is a      \	          |	
			 |             \		  |	
		ConcreteComponent   Decorator
			MethodA				MethodA
			MethodB             MethodB
			                     |      \
								 |       \
								 |        \
					ConcreteDecorator1     ConcreteDecorator2	
	
	
									
Facade Pattern (Structural)
	Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces	in a sub system
	Facade defines a high level interface that makes the sub system easier to use
	
	
Proxy design pattern(Structural design pattern)
Proxy Design Pattern is a type of structural design pattern which is used whenever we need a placeholder or representational object
that can work in place of the real object. The proxy acts as an intermediatory layer between the client and the real object and 
hence can control the access to the real object, add additional functionality, and even restrict client access. 
It is also known as Surrogate Pattern.

A proxy is basically a substitute for an intended object which we create due to many reasons e.g. security reasons or
cost associated with creating fully initialized original object.
Proxy is heavily used to implement lazy loading related usecases where we do not want to create full object until it is actually needed.

Subject – is an interface which expose the functionality available to be used by the clients.
Real Subject – is a class implementing Subject and it is concrete implementation which needs to be hidden behind a proxy.
Proxy – hides the real object by extending it and clients communicate to real object via this proxy object. 
Usually frameworks create this proxy object when client request for real object



public interface RealObject 
{
  public void doSomething();
}
public class RealObjectImpl implements RealObject {
 
  @Override
  public void doSomething() {
    System.out.println("Performing work in real object");
  }
 
}
public class RealObjectProxy extends RealObjectImpl 
{
  @Override
  public void doSomething() 
  {
    //Perform additional logic and security
    //Even we can block the operation execution
    System.out.println("Delegating work on real object");
    super.doSomething();
  }
}

     }

public interface ProxyCommand implements Icommand(){
     private boolean isRoot=false;
     private OriginalCommand originalCommand;
     public ProxyCommand(String user){
         if (user.equals("root")
            isRoot=true;
         originalCommand= new originalCommand;
     }
     @Override
     public void runCommand(String input){
     if(command.equals"rm" && !isRoot){
         Sop("not allowed")
          }
      else{
            originalCommand.run(input);
