Data Science
		Science of discovering hidden patterns(trends, cycles, rules, association between attributes, groups in data) from large data sets
		Data sets/Data is usually prepared ->cleansed and structured for the analysis
		Science->  	statistical tools and techniques employed to understand the data and reliability of identified patterns		
						Part of Statistics related to understanding data is called descriptive analytics(spread, shape,structure, mean,distribution, gives vital insights about data)
						Part of Statistics for establishing the reliability of data is called inferential statistics (mean distribution)
						
		Data Science lies at the intersection of Computer Science, Math & Statistics & Business/Domain Knowledge
		Data is the footprints of happenings (natural or human driven) Physical as in files, registers now more digital (browsing, online purchases)
		Data is the raw material that contains information in it as also noise
			Eg Ticket Sales, Survey Data
		Information is processed data 
		OR It is the data plus the meaning of what the data was collected for minus the noise
		Data is the input, Information is the output
		Data is unprocessed but information is processed which is made sense of
